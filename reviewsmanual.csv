"My stay at islam's place was really cool! Good location, 5min away from subway, then 10min from downtown. The room was nice, all place was clean. Islam managed pretty well our arrival, even if it was last minute ;) i do recommand this place to any airbnb user :)",1
Great location for both airport and city - great amenities in the house: Plus Islam was always very helpful even though he was away,1
We really enjoyed our stay at Islams house. From the outside the house didn't look so inviting but the inside was very nice! Even though Islam himself was not there everything was prepared for our arrival. The airport T Station is only a 5-10 min walk away. The only little issue was that all the people in the house had to share one bathroom. But it was not really a problem and it worked out fine. We would recommend Islams place for a stay in Boston. ,1
The room was nice and clean and so were the commodities. Very close to the airport metro station and located in quite safe area. Islam responds very quickly and is very helpful. I would recommend it. ,1
"Great location. Just 5 mins walk from the Airport Station. Good food nearby.
Room was simple, clean, just what I was after.",1
"A truely exeptional place to stay. The hosts are amazingly friendly, the rooms are spotless, and there is WiFi.
The location is superb: A Latin-American neighborhood close to the airport and just a few subway rides away from downtown. Highly recommened!
",1
"It was a really nice time in Boston - best place to stay over in Boston !! Really nice and helpful hosts - taking there time to explain all the good things to see and how to come there.
We had a really nice time in Boston and they had a big part on that.
If you want to go out doing sth - just ask them and they may come with you.
Really nice and clean house - near to the airport and the subway station ( like 6 minutes away ). 

We had a really good time there and can just recommend it to anyone who want to have a comfortable and enjoyable place to stay in Boston for a good price. Thanks a lot.

"Islam is a very nice guy ! Attentive, funny, he gave me recommandation and info about boston ( nightlife, places to go and so on) 
His flat is clean, tidy and there is a patio which is a real plus! 
I DO recommand this, great experience !",1
"The place is really well furnished, pleasant and clean. Islam was very helpful, you can feel free to ask him virtually anything and he'll help you. He was fun too, very cool talking to him. Oh, and the place is pretty conveniently located too. Highly recommended.

The neighbourhood might not be the cleanest in Boston (my gf liked Brooklyne much more in that matter), but this is a great location and price for value overall.",1
"Our stay at Islam's place was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better value on location and amenities. We felt very much at home and comfortable at his place and would be quick to stay with him again if we return to Boston!

Islam was always quick to respond to any questions or concerns we had and very accommodating at every point in our trip! Truly a wonderful place and a lovely host!",1
"Our stay at Islam's was very enjoyable, Islam is a very kind and responsive host.
The room was clean and comfortable and the house is provided with all comforts: full kitchen, satellite TV, comfortable living room, excellent WIFI connection in all areas.
It is extremely conveniently located to downtown Boston (a few metro stops) and walking distance to the free shuttles connecting to the airport. ",1
"Communication with Islam and his brother was good. However, we arrived at their house and the toilet was completely plugged up and full of excrements. At this point, we were totally disgusted. We went out to town, which by train takes about 15mn plus 10mn walk to the station. We managed to speak with Islam brother. He fixed the problem when we came back by 4pm. 

The house is basic with thin walls and the bedrooms are minimum comfort. We were supposed to be on the basement, which I really don't recommend. Bad smell and the bed is for one person rather than two. We stayed in the upper room, as we though we were there. Nobody in the house except from one guest staying also in the upper level. 

Islam sent us an email during our stay, which we couldn't see as we didn't have a computer with us or the use of our smartphone. However, he told us to stay in the basement while no booking was made for the upper room. Not sure why he wanted us to stay in the basement where the room and bed were very basic, when he could have told us to stay in the room upstairs!

The fact that the owner wasn't there made it a strange feeling. The back door in the kitchen were not locked at all, while our luggage was in the house. We didn't got told at all. We had to put a bar across to kinda off close the sliding door but felt very unsafe as anybody could have walking in easily or made their way in.

All in all, things went fine by the end but we definitely not recommend the place unless the owner is there. If you are looking for a cheap place to stay and don't mind of those inconvenience, then you will like it.

A part from that Boston is a great city and we had fun!

"Well sized room for two people with the basic necessities which also included a mini fridge. Our room, the common areas and bathrooms were clean when we arrived. There were good kitchen facilities but we did not have to use them. 

Overall good value for a location that is close enough to downtown Boston. ",1
"GREAT SPACE, PERFECT LOCATION, AWESOME PEOPLE!! Definately will be back!!!! ",1
"The room was exactly as pictured, no frills, yet adequate for my needs. The street parking was nearly impossible to find,  but you can't expect much better in Boston. I'd recommend this room to others...",1
The room was clean and very comfortable. Having a key for this room also made it very safe. Getting to downtown is also very easy and fast. The whole is also very nice from the inside offering everything needed. I would definetly come back!,1
Izzy was great... had clear instructions and no problems entering the house... the neighborhood wasn't great though.,0
"The place was really good, it is like 10 minutes from the airport so it was  perfect for me because i had a connection flight, the taxi will cost u max 15 dolars and if you go by shuttle is free, the house is very clean and the room was very confortable. The only thing is that i arrive and the owner wasnt there and i didnt read the instructions where he told me how to get in the house so i was waiting for about an hour, but if you read the instructions everything will be fine.",1
"The host wasn't there, but it was fine. He left clear instructions, and we spent 2 good nights there. It was a room was in a shared house, where there happened to be some interesting people staying, so we got to chat with some awesome people. The neighborhood is ok, had some good Colombian food.",1
Izzy was a nice and helpful host with detailed directions. The room is in the basement and even though Izzy mentions it we somehow missed that detail and it has narrow stairs leading down to it which made it hard for us to carry our bags up and down. We are unfortunately traveling with really heavy bags. The place is in East Boston and is extremely convenient for the airport.,1
"We arrived late from the airport, so the location was very convenient, just a 5 min walk from the airport T station. Check-in was quick and easy and the room as described. It's also very close to downtown Boston. We had a perfect stay and would definitely stay there again.
",1
"Izzy was quick to reply to our request, and provided thorough instructions related to finding and entering the home. We loved the convenience of the location near the airport, as we weren't familiar with Boston, and landed late at night, so we didn't want to have to travel far or follow complicated directions to find the place. Although we never had any face-to-face contact with Izzy or anyone else in the home during our brief overnight stay, we felt comfortable there. Although we were assured that the neighborhood was safe, we were still feeling a bit on edge walking late at night from the Airport ""T"" station. Nonetheless, we made our way there without incident, and had a restful night of sleep before launching out the next day. Thanks, Izzy!",1
Everything is exactly as posted! super convenient + easy to find.,1
"We didn´t meet Izzy at all!!!! After we arrived nobody was there except some spanish speaking people.
Our room was disgusting!!! It smelted like mold and was very dirty!!!!
The Bathroom wasn´t cleaned either and my friend and i wanted to leave right after we came…
The Dryer or washer was not usable because the assistant from Izzy washed all the time.
The Neighborhood is not safe at all and every other morning u could hear people fight.
Don´t stay there!!!!!! It´s nothing like u would expect it! 
And it´s defenetly to expensive for this nasty place!!!! ",0
"I didn't get a chance to meet Izzy but I thought the system that was set up was really well done. Things went quite smoothly upon arrival as per the detailed instructions that were left. 

We managed to get the key from the lock box easily which was nice because it provided flexibility for whatever time we arrived. This place is extremely close to the airport. I've never stayed next door to the airport before. Less than a 5 min ride to Airport Station which was then a 5 min walk.

Place had everything. Felt very homely like staying at a friends. Location was amazing!! East Boston has some hidden gem restaurants and proximity to Airport subway station was key. No complaints about the room or bathroom.

Great setup Izzy!",1
"Izzy's assistant was a nice and helpful person. We stayed 7 days, kitchen had everything one needs to make good food even a mixer! Our room was in the cellar and therefore very private. One fight next door where we heard screaming and shouting but overall a very calm neighbourhood and friendly people.",1
"Host wasn't there, but instructions were clear to find and get in the place. Convenient location and a decent neighborhood (safe but a bit run-down and not much around). The room was basic but had everything I needed.",1
Izzy's place was very convenient for getting to the airport. The room was cosy and clean. I was impressed with the tea selections. Izzy's friend was helpful and friendly. Definitely will come back when we have to fly out from Boston again!  ,1
"Well we were kind of annoyed to be honest. We chose the most expensive room in the house because we were meant to be the only ones on the bottom floor, and we were told we would get a computer...
Well we had his assistant sleep right outside our door and we did not have a computer. 
On top of that, every room had a TV but ours, and the tv in the living room did not get basic channels which frustrated us. 

The house was a mess up until the day we left, because izzy was apparently coming home that day, so his assistant decided to clean up. It was a totally different house upon checkout. 
His assistant was lovely, just not much help...
As far as The location goes, it is convenient to downtown and the airport, and has local shops and restaurants close by. 
We did enjoy our stay overall there was just more than enough frustrating elements..",0
"We never met our host, but they were willing to book the room with little notice.  The room was clean.

There's a little cafe a few blocks up the street that made for a perfect breakfast.

We didn't realize that other people would be staying too, so when they came it was a little spooky until we met them.",1
"It was a great place to stay. Quiet, clean and close to shops, airport and public transportation.  Would recommend and stay here again.",1
"Overall a pleasing experience.  We flew into Boston for one night to go to a concert.  Izzy left straight forward and easy to read instructions on how to reach the flat, and enter.  The room was as pictured, and exactly what we needed for the night. Izzy was readily available to us by phone or text whenever we had any questions. The flat is really close to the airport, and only a small hop into the heart of Boston, it was very convenient for us! :)",1
"Boston is one of the best city's I have ever been.
Issy's place is good located, and nice. 
I would recommend this place for everybody!",1
Clear directions.  Good neighborhood. Close to t station. Clean room. Quiet. Perfect!,1
The host actually gave us a place to sleep. It is really simple. Very close to subway was perfect. There have several problems the host needs to improve. ,0
"OK stay.  Perhaps best for those on the young/adventurous side of the spectrum!  There was a sign that said 'in the process of renovations'.   I think the second floor might be a little noisy some evenings, with 3 rooms up there. The one lower/ground floor room was quieter, but keep in mind not easily accessible with narrow winding stairs. Futon style bed.     The host was prompt with text message responses to questions about parking.  Parking in the neighborhood mid-day was easy but all streets were filled with parked/double parked cars by 5pm.  It was a fairly short walk to the Blue line train line - Airport station. ",0
"Izzy was very helpful with directions and he was easy to get in touch with, as I had some questions.  This is a great location that is a short walk to the airport shuttle.  The room is in the basement and it gets hot during the day.  The house has A/C upstairs, but this does not reach the basement room so it was pretty hot.  The neighborhood a little bit ethnic, which I didn't mind, but if this makes you uncomfortable you might want to look elsewhere.  I felt safe, and the lockbox system is secure.  

For a traveler like myself who had an early flight out of Logan, this was the cost effective option.  Can't beat the price for a location so close to the airport!",1
This was ok it was easy with clear information on how getting in the house and it was very safe. The host wasn't there during the stay. The neighborhood is not so nice to hang out at night.,0
"Izzy was out of the town when I stayed there. The location is very close to the airport, and the neighborhood is quiet and friendly.  I enjoyed my stay there and made a reservation for an additional night. ",1
"Unfortunately, we can't agree with the many positive reviews. The house was easy to find and just a short 7 minute walk from the T-Station ""Airport"", but not what I would describe as clean. After arrival I started to clean a bit. E.g. the hob in the spacious kitchen, which you can use including all the inventory(and what's perfect for a nice breakfast), was kind of greasy and that didn't change during our three day stay. Sure this isn't a hotel and the guests are responsible for cleanliness as well, but the host takes a cleaning fee. If they would clean the house on a regular basis, it would be a nice accommodation, as we really liked the premises. Our basement room had a little fridge, a mirror, a tv and a luggage stand what we appreciated. Somehow we missed the ""warm welcome"" feeling  we experienced at other airbnb locations. ",0
"East Boston is very nice place, well connected to the whole city and all services needed at walking distance. 
The house is exactly as described, very easy to find and check in, lots of common space and nice environment. Izzy does not living in, but it's not a problem at all! He's very helpful and answered immediately to every need we had.
The house is clean, not so much the room in the basement.",1
"We arrived late and left early in the morning but everything was good. Easy to find, good instructions,  comfortable bed.",1
"Izzy's room is a great value for an airport related stay. The convenience to the airport is even better than it seems in the description. 
The room was clean as were sheets and towels. 
The room could have benefitted from AC because it was August but Izzy gave us a powerful and quiet fan so we were okay.",1
Had a good experience overall. Short and sweet. ,1
"It was a pleasant stay although we didn't meet personally. The room was comfortable, the metro station is close and it is really fast to get into Boston so al together we had a great time there.",1
Izzy's home is conveniently located for anyone visiting Boston and we were made to feel very at home. The neighborhood appears sketchy and was uncomfortable to walk through at night. Still an overall positive experience.,1
"Izzy's listing was as described, the room was perfect for our short stay at Boston. Although we never got to meet izzy, his brother made us feel more than welcome and helped us with anything we needed. The location was also good for us, only a few minutes from the tracks which took us straight in to Boston. ",1
"It has a quiet, convenient and safe environment.I really enjoy the stay and the talking with our host who is very nice and helpful. ",1
"We had a great Time in Boston! We really enjoyed our stay at Izzys Place. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. There is only one bathroom in the house, but some how the bath wasnt usually blocked. We never had to wait long. 
You only Need About 5 Minutes to the t-station and only 3 Station to downtown, which was very nice. We can recommend izzys Place - thank for everything. Nora & Hannah ",1
"Location is super convenient! Very short walk to the airport shuttle. Great restaurants in the area. (Try the Bandeja Paisa at El Penol 

A few mix ups due to my last-minute booking, but everything was made right very quickly. Great customer service. Not the fanciest place in the world, but perfect for the budget traveler.

Since other rooms in the home are also rented out through Airbnb, got to meet some other interesting travelers. ",1
"The house was very easy to find (although it was my first time in the US and Boston) and really within walking distance of the airport. Everything was exactly as described, and we did not experience any problems during our stay (short as it was). We got a clean room with a comfortable bed, and the bathroom was also nice. If I have to stay in Boston for the night again and get back to the airport real quick, Izzy's house would be my first choice.",1
"I didn't meet Izzy, but his roommate was very nice and helpful.
The room is in a very good condition, clean and you have enough space. The location is safe and close to the metro station, it is very easy to find the house.
",1
"good location close to the (URL HIDDEN) metro station
clean house and rooms.
I did not have the chance to meet the owner but he was though quiet responsive and reactive when needed.",1
"very close from the airport
clean
I could even do laundry with free of charge.",1
Really nice place. Exactly as the pictures displayed it. Very easy directions and simple directions to find it. Would definitely recommend it to anyone coming to Boston. ,1
"The house was in a very convenient location to the airport (we walked to the shuttle) and the bed/room was clean. Not a great neighborhood, but again it was booked to be close to our early morning flight.",1
"Hard tofind parking.  One night's sleep is alright.  We didn't get to use the one only bathroom, which is shared by all.  There are 4 rooms with a total of 8 people, so it's like sharing one bathroom with 8 people.",0
"Izzy's place is the perfect location for those leaving to and from Logan airport, really short walking distance and a few subway stops to downtown Boston. We had a nice stay at Izzy's. The room was clean and Izzy provided a very detailed instruction of how to get to the house and everything we might need. If there's any downside I can think of is that there's only one washroom in the house and sometimes there's a wait time to use it due to the many other guests that stayed in the house. Overall, we barely have any issues and enjoyed our vacation at Izzy's place. Cheers! ",1
"Staying at Izzy's was very convenient, especially because we had had all the information needed prior to our stay. The place was exactly as pictured. To me its location was definitely the winner, access to airport and subway was really easy. On top of that, the house was clean and well taken care of. Despite being situated in the basement, the room was also very nice and quite spacious. I liked how we had enough shelving to put our things. The only thing I wished to be different was that there was only one bathroom for all guests to share. ",1
The room was as advertised.  It was comfortable and clean.  The system for checking in and checking out was also very convenient.,1
"Great location, no need to take a subway or taxi to get there from the airport.
Perfect if you need to be close to the airport.
Beware room is very bright at night.",1
"Parking situation was bad.  Very hard to find a spot. :-( So if you are driving I don't recommend.  On the positive side of things, the place was very clean and close to the airport.",0
had everything needed! ,1
"Everything was as described.  Izzy is a great host, even cooked us a delicious host and made sure all questions and concerns of ours were taken care of.  The apartment is in a great location for anybody visiting Boston.  Would highly recommend to anyone.",1
"Izzy's place is perfect! My friend and I really enjoyed our stay! Our room is located on the first floor of the house, and is very spacious and clean. The living room, kitchen and bathroom are all clean, spacious and cozy. Izzy offered various tea bags, coffee, chocolate, fruit, bread etc. which is very nice. This place really feels like home. 

Izzy's really warm and kind. He helped us carry luggage to our room and opened mistakenly closed room door early in the morning. The Italian seafood place he recommended, Rino's, is beyond delicious! We ordered some mussels and lobster ravioli. And, it's only one block away!

Overall, our stay in Izzy's place is lovely. It's close to transport station, which has shuttle buses that take you to the airport for only about 15 minutes and subways to the downtown area. 

I'll definitely recommend this place to my friends!",1
"I was occupied during the day and only made it home around 11PM each night so I did not have a chance to meet the host. 
Nevertheless, the house was clean, and the room was spacious. In addition, I think the best thing about this place is the fact that the location was really convenient, about 6 minutes of walk along large street after getting off of the subway station (which also has free shuttles to airport). ",1
"The place was perfectly located for my airport transit and so easy to get to, especially with the detailed instructions that were provided by Izzy.  

The house is in cool neighbourhood and there is an excellent Mexican spot right around the corner (Angela's cafe).  All amenities I needed were provided.  The room had a controllable heater, so I could adjust the temperature myself.

Izzy is an awesome, cool host, who takes a genuine interest in his guests. ",1
"I had to make a last-minute and late reservation. Izzy was great, and the room was clean, comfortable and quiet. Just what I needed.
",1
"We didn't get to meet Izzy, but did meet his brother. The house and room were very clean and comfortable. We had everything we needed.",1
We had a good experience.  Very short in and out but it was great to be next to the airport.  Thanks,1
"Absolutely no complaints about my stay. Very easy to access from the airport (walking) with great instructions that Izzy sent beforehand. Only met Izzy's brother. He was great, friendly and welcoming. The room had everything it needed to have. I was given a key to lock the room while I was gone during the day. Would highly recommend staying here!",1
"We didn't get to meet Izzy, but the room was very nice and the location was good! Would love to come back.",1
"I had to catch an early morning flight and needed a place to crash for one short night. This place was perfect as it was close to the airport (short walk to the airport shuttle stop). I did not get to meet Izzy but his brother was a good host. The room in the basement was clean, comfortable, warm and quiet. Highly recommended for convenience of airport access.",1
"The room we stayed in was very clean and nicely appointed. Unfortunately I didn't meet the host, but I liked the idea of how it was managed. I would recommend to stay there and would definitely stay there the next time I'm around Boston. ",1
It was a really good time there. The host was really friendly and helpful. Definitely a good place to stay during a trip to Boston.  ,1
The place was great! I stayed earlier in the week and returned again on my return to Boston because the people are easy going and the place is cozy and quiet for getting work done.,1
It was perfect room for my business trip. I believe that Izzy chose that room for me as he considered the nature of my trip. It was very quiet as it was separate from other areas. I could rest well every night. The room temperature was perfect for my comfortable stay. The house was well-maintained and very clean. I strongly felt that it was a home away from home in that sense. Rosie was very nice. She baked a nice breadless cake for all of us with yogurt frosting and chocolate chips on top. I would love to stay at Izzy's again and again if I have more business trips to the area in the future. Thank you Izzy!,1
"It's a great place to stay. The neighborhood is quiet and beautiful. The house is only 10-15 minutes away from the metro station. The room is spacious, clean  and comfortable. The bathroom is clean and big too. We can use kitchen freely. The whole experience is great. We will definitely stay there again next time when we visit Boston.",1
Room was exactly what listing posted. Had no problem finding location and host was very accommodating though we never formally met. Room even had a little heater and it was perfect for my stay. I would stay here again.,1
Good private accommodation. The room was exactly as mentioned.  Would highly recommend it.,1
"The space was extremely comfortable and very cozy. Although I never saw Izzy during my stay there he did make me feel very welcome. It was very easy to find the place and it was also very simple to check in and get situated. Overall, it was a very nice stay and I plan on staying here whenever I come to Boston",1
"Even though I never got to meet Izzy, the whole experience was great. The room is spacious, clean and cozy and exactly as mentioned. Had no problem finding location. Overall, it was a really nice stay. Thanks :) ",1
"I had to book a last minute stay the day before and Izzy was really nice to give me immediate and fast response. He assured me I have that room although I had technical problems with Airbnb, again. Izzy was always responsive throughout my stay, though I didn't get to see him. I went there the day after the snow storm. Arrived at South Station. (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) taught me to walk 15 mins to the blue T line. But I took the silver line and then the free airport shuttle. It was actually better option considering my heavy luggage. I arrived the day after the snow storm. The distance from the airport subway station to the apartment wasn't far, but the excessive snow made it really difficult to walk. The pathways were narrow n the steps were hard to climb with my luggage. But by evening, it was nice that the snow were shoveled from the steps. I personally like the place a lot - homey and comfy and has everything I need. It's easy and fast to get to the airport n main attractions too.",1
We stayed with Izzy just for one night because it was close to Logan airport and I had a flight the next morning. He was really nice and the room was warm and comfy! Good location with parking. I would definitely recommend staying here!,1
"Izzy is a great host. He helped us with the luggage and was ready to answer us with any questions we may have had. He was in the house the whole week and he gave us plenty of privacy. We could use for free washer and dryer and the kitchen was always available. We had some trouble finding a car park because of the snow so we had to park 10-minute walk away from our street, anyway was also nice to hang out with the other airbnb guests and share cultures :) The bathroom was always available and also you could use towels and everything was clean. We could t really go around the neighbourhood but we were close to a cvs pharmacy, a grocery shop and the blue line station (airport stop).
I would definitely stay there again!!!",1
"Nice place, great location! Neighborhood is great, many local restaurants, cafés, etc. Close to downtown, 5-10 mins. Izzy has been a great host; welcoming and present to help his guests! We had an amazing time!",1
"The place was right on, no surprises. Izzy was a nice guy, pretty laid back. The house was close to the subway, but the 5 blocks between the two would be a little unnerving to walk at night.",1
"Izzy was a gracious and generous host.  He was flexible with check-in and accommodating with all facets of our stay.  He even was able to help some other travelers who'd had a bad experience with another AirBNB host.  solid guy.

One detail to be aware of - there is only one bathroom shared amongst numerous guests.  If you're ok with a little bathroom sharing and potentially waiting in line, this is a perfectly fine place to stay.
",1
"Although we planned this trip to Boston quite spontaneous, we did not have any issues with finding an accommodation at Iyyz Jm's place. The direction from the public transportation were very straight forward and explained everything very well. Once we arrived at the place, we fount very clean, well-decorated, and welcoming rooms. A personal welcome note further helped us considering this place as our new home for two days. We shared the entire house with two other airbnb'ers, which were really nice and polite as well. Overall, I'm very happy I've fount this place and can certainly recommend it to everyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune for the hotels downtown!",1
"It was a great location, very close to the airport and easy to find. The apartment was well-furnished. The room was clean and comfortable, and the bathroom was shared with other guests. Excellent stay! Highly recommend this listing!",1
"I did a self check-in which went very smoothly as Izzy's detailed directions were very easy to follow. The house was very close to Airport Station, and the neighborhood was fine. Kitchen and livingroom were beautiful, my room in the basement was simple, clean, and comfortable. There was even a small space heater to keep me warm during the night. Everything was well-organized and welcoming. The other guests were very nice as well. I would definitely stay here again!",1
Everything was great--izzy was very detailed in his instructions and it was an easy stay!,1
"The place was as advertized - a private room, great price, close to the airport, etc. And while I am reluctant to give negative feedback I felt that Izzi is running an operation here that is not consistent with my values, and what I believe are the implicit values of the AirBnB ""community.""

The host actually does not live in the place, rather he lives out of state and has some caretaker changing the sheets and keeping the place clean. So in essence the place is a low security hotel or hostel - except with no management present to deal with any contingencies that might come up between guests. Given that there is shared intimate space the proprietor is relying on the generally good character of the ""AirBnB Community"" to make sure that nothing untoward occurs. Chances are that nothing untoward will occur, but it is an exposure.

What I also feel is happening in this sort of operation is that it is a business being run in a residential area - compromising the coherency of the neighborhood and riding on the infrastructure of legitimate hotels  (who pay hotel taxes, liability insurance, employment taxes, and other commercial fees) while not paying for the infrastructure that these taxes and fees pay for.

This is America, where entrepreneurial enterprise is rewarded. But this is also America where this can mean concentrating enterprise efforts on profit centers, and externalizing cost centers. The impacts of that externalization do not decrease the costs, they just end up in someone else in-basket.  My sense of conviviality eschews externalizing costs to the expense of the neighborhood or local businesses.",0
The space is nice enough and it's *great* value. I wouldn't say that the way that the host welcomed me was especially warm and friendly -- there was a form message that instructed me on how to get into the apartment. I think the message could be more personalized.,1
"It was very nice, everything was fine and comfy, even though the host didnt stay at all in the house (no big deal)",1
"Great location for the airport - however we couldn't go through the park as the gate was locked, which made getting to the airport for our early morning flight a little stressful. Otherwise - great room, great location and great price!",1
"Close to the airport, affordable, hardly knew i was in someones house it was so quiet. Can't really ask for more for your stopover in Boston. Make sure you leave with plenty of time to go North of the East Boston Memorial Park if your flight is in the early morning as the gates will be chained. Going up the greenbelt trail i was able to make it to the T station in plenty of time.",1
"Izzy's place was extremely convenient fir us since it's so clise to the airport and just twi subway stops away from downtown. we loved to see the ""real"" Boston in a cool, safe neighborhood, and also loved some of the restaurants nearby. Although we didn't get to meet Izzy, he was very accomodating to our needs. Would definitely recommend fir anyone looking for good value in Boston.",1
Izzy's communication is very good. All communication was done via text or AirBnB messaging. Directions and house details were well spelled out & clear. I was in the basement room of the 3 rooms he rents out. Everything is clean but spares. I would not consider it cozy but it was a very good value. ,1
"I did not see Izzy during my stay, but the check-in instructions delivered by email were very clear. The home is run much like a hostel - I was welcomed by a white-board on the door of my room.  Everyone else staying in the house was very nice and helped me feel at home. There are shared tea/coffee supplies, slippers, and a space heater for my room, all of which were nice touches! The neighborhood is Mexican-American, with many ethnic food choices. There was no great place for groceries or coffee, but Santarpio's pizza is the best in Boston and is within walking distance of the house (cash only - worth every penny!) The Government Center Station on the T is closed until 2016, which means you have to make at least 2 transfers to get anywhere downtown or in Back Bay.  Had I realized this before my stay, I would have probably stayed downtown. Taxi drivers grumbled about driving to East Boston because of the tolls and my Taxi/Uber fares for 2 days cost nearly $100. ",0
"Our stay was quite good at Izzy's place. Getting in touch with him was easy, he is very reachable and answers quickly to all the questions. We arrived really early in the morning but we managed to put our stuff in the house before the check-in. The location is perfect for people travelling from the airport - it's a 7 minutes walk to the subway station and a 10 min subway ride to downtown which is fine. 
The only problem with the house is that there is only one bathroom for 4 rooms, so it's kind of bothering when everyone wants to shower in the morning.
And -1 for the cleaning and the garbage that was not changed in the room after the ones that were there before us!
But overall it's a good price/value room, specially that it's in the basement so far from the other rooms.",1
I checked in at midnight. & left at. 9:00 am. The room & bathroom were very clean & quiet. Highly recommend it.,1
"The place is very close to the Airport T Station. So very convenient to travel around Boston. The listing was as described for the most part. I had the room in the basement. The bathroom was clean and so was the kitchen. 
I met Izzy on the second and he was very welcoming. Overall I was pleased with the place",1
" I enjoyed my stay at Izzy's place. He gave me very detailed directions, so finding his place was a breeze. My room was in the basement which made it feel more private. The room had a fridge, mirror, towels, hangers and even slippers. Sharing a bathroom was a little tricky, but no one ever took too long.  The bathroom did need a bit of cleaning, especially the bathtub. Getting to and from downtown Boston was relatively easy once you get the hang of the subway system. The neighborhood was nice, we saw parents walking their kids to school in the morning and I felt safe walking late at night. Overall this is a great value. I would stay here if I'm ever in Boston again.",1
"Izzy is very friendly and he provided assistance when I was there ,which made us feel like living in our own home.
The room is clean and tidy. It was also convenient to go to downtown since it is close to the airport station, which take only a few stops to go downtown.",1
"I booked this room for my mom and her friends, it the room downstair, Izzy write my name on the board in front of the door and makes me feel welcome. My mom and her friends said they like the room so i give 5 stars for it. ",1
"The ''self'' check-in was really easy.
The fact that there is just one bathroom for all the guests is not optimal but we manage to make it work.
Great location, really close to a subway station and it's easy to get to Downtown Boston.",1
We had a great stay at Izzy's place. The space was as described and in a super convenient location. There are lots of shops and restaurants within walking distance and is a short walk to airport station. We would definitely return! ,1
"I had an excellent experience at Izzi's place. It was my first Airbnb experience and he took time to explain everything before my arrival. When I arrived, he was very welcoming and easy to talk to. I also got along very well with his house manager, Victoria. They're both awesome people. The room was clean and welcoming. I liked being able to use the fridge and oven and just hang out in the living room. The location was ideal since it was within easy walking distance of the tram and airport, plus there are several good restaurants within a few blocks. I will definitely stay here again when I'm in Boston again.",1
"Izzy responded to all messages quickly before the stay. He gave clear directions to property and how to get in. He offered me a place to leave my bag early in the day before check-in. The room was clean and comfortable with a fridge and fan. He was very friendly and offered me suggestions about where to go to dinner and when to leave for my early morning flight. There were many other guests in home and common area but all were polite and quiet. Overall, excellent stay and great value for the area.",1
"We had a nice time at Izzy's place, the description of his place was excellent and he provided a lot of nice hints for activities in the city. 
Generally he is a great host, really relaxed and very caring. There have been other AirBnB guest during our visit but the place was never crowded or overfilled.",1
Izzy made me feel at home.  He has a great place to stay. I highly recommend him. ,1
Great location for next to the airport!  Very nice host!  Izzy was very accommodating with respect to check in and checking out.  It made our stay great!,1
"Izzy was great! Very comprehensive instructions on how to get to his place from the airport; we arrived early, meaning to put our luggage in the hall but our room was already ready! He also lives ONE BLOCK away from the awesome Rino's Place - definitely go there and hv your italian meal! Izzy was also most kind to send us to the airport and carry my luggage (with one arm). Thank you Izzy! A pleasure to stay with you!",1
"Very convenient location, about 10 minute walk to airport shuttle and rail. House was quiet and clean, easy in and out.",1
"We arrived very late, but the home was easy to find and there was someone there waiting to great us. The room was as described, worked perfect for a quick sleep. ",1
"izzy is a great host. He really makes sure everything is smooth for check-in, move out and luggage storage. All instructions are clear and straightforward. My flight got delayed and i arrived around 11.30 pm and didn't encounter any issues checking in.",1
This was my second Airbnb experience. It was easy and uncomplicated. The neighborhood was fine and safe. Everything from grocery store to Metro station was in close walking distance. I will definitely stay at Izzy's again!,1
"reach this place by Uber. It is good, clean and conformable. The room is in basement which I don't know before negotiate with the host. Still, house is good, clean. This is the most important!",1
I only stayed for one night. The room was really nice and Victoria was very helpful with everything :) I really enjoyed the stay.,1
"We can recommend this accommodation. But you should know, this is not a ""real"" AirBnB experience. We didn't meet Izzy at our days in Boston. But this is not a negative point. If you read Izzy's description completely he mentions this. The house is more like a small hostel with lots of travellers than a private room. Unfortunately there is only one bathroom (one shower) which sometimes causes in problems at the morning. Our room and bathroom were clean. The location is a good point to explore the city and is not far away from the airport. Metro is 5 min away by foot. There are also some supermarkets and other shops not far away.",1
Izzy was great! Everything was organized properly and she gave clear instructions which made getting there and moving in to our room easy! Also we were lucky to have to room downstairs which allowed us to have a bit more privacy. Everything was well organized and clean even in bathroom and kitchen making us feel welcome.,1
"Hey Izzy,
thanks for having me in your apartment. I found it most convenient and it was just perfect for my purpose. I did like the area with the Mexican and specifically Columbian Restaurants!",1
"I didn't get to meet Izzy but he had a friend that greeted us. His place is nice but a little bit dusty. The room, kitche, bathroom, has everything you need. The bed is comfortable. It's a good space for two people. The neighborhood is so-so, our neighbors were having a reggae party that made it hard to sleep. ",1
"Great place! Izzy had things explained and laid out really nicely, was very easy to find the place from the T station. ",1
"Great space. Cozy and right off the airport, very easy to find. I'd have stayed here even if we weren't arriving quite late but oh was it nice to get from the airport to the room in under 8 minutes (and $12 cab fare, with tip).  Nice, open kitchen and living room that we had no time to use, sadly.

Izzy has apple accommodations. Towels, sheets, kitchenware, even emergency toiletries in case you've forgotten yours. This was my first AirBNB trip and it certainly left a great impression.",1
"I really liked the place! specially if you need to reach the airport early in the morning, this place is just a couple blocks away from the airport metro station! My room (D) was clean and huge, and I was welcomed at my arrival. The house has other people but it is very quiet and has really nice common areas! I would totally stay here again next time!!!",1

"This is not a luxury hotel, but it was the perfect place for a night in Boston. It was very clean and easy to get to/from, and Izzy's assistant, Victoria was very helpful. I'd definitely recommend it for an inexpensive place to stay in Boston!",1
"Izzy was friendly. The house was fine.  The instructions were good.  I liked the ethnically diverse neighborhood, especially the Brazillian restaurant, Oliverias, and the Italian Place, Rino's.  There is also an amazing Candlepin Bowling (the original bowling with small wooden balls) Alley, called Central Park Lanes right down the street.  The house was fine, clean and well stocked.  We were in the basement which was comfortable, well furnished and clean.  I wish I had known I was going to get the basement room. I probably wouldn't have stayed there.  It was a little stuffy and the stairs down felt really narrow.  Luckily we were able to open the windows.  Cold air drops so it was also nice and cool in the basement. Overall, I would stay here again but request a room upstairs.
",1
"Although we didn't get a chance to meet Izzy everything was as described. The instructions provided were very clear and we had no trouble finding the place and the room. There are several rooms in the house which was actually more like a small youth hostel. There were other guests present using the shared facilities (kitchen/bath room/living room), however it was no issue. Sometimes there may be a waiting time for the bath room as there is only one. For us it provided what we were looking for: a place (VERY!) close to the airport to spend one night. The neighbourhood is not the most affluent one but we didn't feel unsafe at any time (weren't out at night though).",1
"Overall, we were not too impressed with our stay. This is mainly due to a lack of communication between the host and us. We arrived after a very long journey, with no idea where we should go or how to proceed. We stumbled upon our room but never given our own key for our whole stay. The bathroom was inconveniently placed on a different floor to us and was shared with approx. 3 other guests, making for plenty of waiting time. The location is conveniently near the logan airport station and our room was in fact very nice and spacious making for a comfortable stay but it would have been a lot better if the host was actually there to help out.",0
Izzy was really helpful. He was constantly suggesting things to do and the best way to get from point A to point B. He was friendly and well informed. The room was clean and we enjoyed our stay very much!,1
"Awesome, great dude he will have a drink with you tell you where to go and will share experiences with you would recommend ",1
"Nothing like ""a private room"" it's an outdated / renovation overdue house in a strange area/location. Room was dusty (Floor), staircase to the room in the basement was tiny. Somebody used the wash-machine (basement.....) at 1:45. As there wasn't an air conditioning, we had to leave windows open and got woken up often by either passing cars (windows face to the street) or talking people. Cut it short : the house is used to rent out the rooms, the friendly caring lady is taking care about things but the whole thing is commercial. Better add some money and go into a real hotel. Price isn't cheap either. Never again ! It's an abuse of Airbnb ! ",0
Pretty nice room. Izzy wasn't there but his assistant was very friendly. Location is just fine.,1
Great location. Nice neighborhood.  Blue line is within walking distance.   Logan airport nearby.  Perfect if you need to catch a flight.  Highly recommend. ,1
Everything was as we expected. The bedroom was as the description says and even the bathroom was shared with the other guest it was clean. Also we had a very nice evening with Izzy and his friends.,1
"Did not meet Izzy, but his assistant was in the house when we arrived.
Izzy's instructions from Logan Airport to the house were spot on as were the instructions for entry. The room was just as advertised. No air con, but large room fan supplied and was ok. The remainder of the house had air con. Kitchen facilities very good, plenty space and hot water. No problems with the neighbour hood. We did plenty walking and sampled a couple of cafes and a restaurant which were great. Food mostly south and meso American.
Cheers  John and Jill  ( Scotland)",1
"The location is awesome, close to the heart of Boston and every tourist site. But the room didn't seem to be cleaned from the last tenant.",0
"I never met Izzy. Instructions to get into the place were clear. It just took us a few minutes inside to figure out which was our room. It is set up a bit like a hostel, with 4 guest rooms in 1 house. The location was fantastic, within walking distance of the airport. The room was fine, though in a basement and a little humid. The house is in ok condition, with fairly old fixtures but clean. ",1
The house locates near the airport subway station and there is a small mart nearby. Fabiana is a friendly girl to help us get used to this house. The other roommates are friendly as well.,1
"This place was great. Clean, perfect location, cute neighborhood, and friendly host. Izzy was kind enough to chat with us when we arrived, provide recommendations for late night bars and food in the area, teach us about the transportation system and even give us beers after a stressful travel experience. Would definitely stay here again.",1
The host is very organized and helpful. It is a pleasant place to stay. Wish we could stay for more days. Maybe next time. :),1
"We stayed for one night in Izzy's house. The room was clean and had everything we needed. Izzy and his father were friendly hosts. We enjoyed talking to them. 
The house is located in a nice neighbourhood and very close to the Airport and the city of Boston. 
We would stay with Izzy again.",1
"Nice apartment, very convenient location. Host was very friendly.",1
"Izzy was very welcoming. This was my first airb&b experience and it was a positive one. He is located in a great location close to the t metro system, which is great if your traveling to Boston and want to get around for cheap.",1
"Everything was as mentioned. The host was very friendly. The house is in a really great neighborhood, some of the best mexican food aboit 2 blocks away. The bed was a futon, not the most uncomfortable but still not a bed if that is what you require.  Had a great time!",1
Great location with good amenities. Izzy was helpful and informative. The house is more like a hostel but perfect for a couple days stay in Boston.,1
"The house is near the airport and the neighbourhood is a nice area with many (but expensive) cornershops. The check-in procedure was conveniant and the room and the house is well equipped. If  you want to get downtown, you can get a free ride with the silver line from the airport, which inbound-service is always for free. We had a pleasant stay!",1
Everything was easy and as described. Perfect location for an early morning flight out of Logan. ,1
"I don't think it was a good experience. The room was in the basement, while the bathroom was on the ground floor. The heater in the room was not functioning well. Don't think it was worth the money. ",0
"Great spot for proximity to airport!  If headed to room from downtown on subway, be sure to walk over bridge to other side of tracks while still in the station!  Dont walk out of the wrong exit out of station!  Cause they you will have a long walk!  But if you walk over bridge and take the right exit you are a short walk.  Free shuttle from subway station makes this great for catching early morning flights.  Seems like a high volume rate of guests here so definitely has a hostel feel.  Great for leisure travrlers.",1
"It was a great experience! The apartment is very well placed, close to the airport, 10 minutes walking. It was absolutely clean! I didn't meet Izzy, but was very welcomed by a guy who works with him. The room is placed in the basement and there are a toilet and a bathroom sink. There is no other placed to stay. This private room is the best option in Boston.",1
"I did not meet Izzy during my recent stay in Boston, however he had very detailed instructions on how to access the house, where to find parking, as well as check-in/check-out instructions, so everything went smoothly. The room was as advertised, clean, and well equipped, with easy access to the airport. Overall, it fit my needs of a convenient/reasonably priced place to stay for 1 night. ",1
"Wonderful stay, beautiful room, close to airport ",1
"We did not meet Izzy, but the instructions and listing information gave us all the info we needed. It was all we needed for 1 night close to the airport. The house seemed busy, with someone sleeping on the couch when we left.",0
"The experience was great. It was a self check in airbnb, which is the first time I'd ever done that. The directions to get into the place were very clear and easy to follow. The location was right by the airport station on the blue line of T, a six minute walk total. The room was clean and the house was inviting. Great stay!",1
"The neighborhood looks quiet but I felt safe. The house was nice and clean as shown in the picture. It was also pretty convenient to get from place to place as the train station is just a few blocks away. Although I didn't get to meet Izzy, from the conversation we had through messages, he was very understanding and nice. Our housemates are kind too. Overall, my friend and I did have a good experience in Boston. Thank you for letting us stay, Izzy!",1
"Was able to score this place at the last minute. Very easy peasy to access to this place from Logan Airport. She left detailed instructions on how to find/access to this house.

What's even better is that I was allowed to leave my bag here after checking out so I could check out Boston before departing. That's an A plus in my book.

Would recommend to  my friends.",1
"Good house and clean room! Awesome
",1
"Great room, had all necessities that we needed. We didn't get to see Izzy, but was not a problem. Excellent experience.",1
Very good,1
"Our stay was great! We arrived much later than anticipated but the instructions for the self check in were easy to follow and we were fast asleep in no time at all. Great setup, everything is labeled and it is a warm atmosphere. We really enjoyed ourselves! Thanks a bunch! ",1
Very efficient and well run home. Easy to get to from public transit.,1
"The room was very cozy and nice with all the necessary utilities like portable heater, towels, blankets, etc. I enjoyed my stay a lot.",1
"I didn't get to meet Izzy but we exchanged some messages and he seemed to be really nice, the room was cozy and clean, I would definitely stay at this place again.",1
Room is nice an clean with all the necessary utilities. Just a few stops from the city center with a train. Overall a great experience and highly recommended.,1
"The only thing I messed up was not looking at the page of information after we booked. All the information you need to check in and get settled into your room was all there. I did call Izzy and he responded promptly through phone or text. The room was secluded and the place was quiet. I recommend Rino's restaurant, which is like 5 minutes from Izzy's!! Definitely recommend staying here.",1
"I was in the basement room so it was a bit cold but there was a nice portable heater and a small refrigerator. It had nice shelving to hang your clothes and a clean bed. Overall, a great place to stay. Thank you!",1
"This was our first experience with Airbnb and it was amazing! We had the room in the basement which was very private, clean, and warm on one of the coldest days in Boston. There was a space heater we could use which helped, on the day it was -30 degrees Celsius outside. There were also clean extra blankets, lots of pillows and the bed was very comfortable and clean as well. The host also provided us with clean towels, and we were able to lock our door for privacy. The lady we talked with was also very kind and friendly. The location is also very close to the airport subway station, which makes it easy to get around. I would definitely stay here again thank you so much for your hospitality!  ",1
"Izzy's home is really well located in a nice neighbourhood with easy access to the airport and downtown Boston. However we found it a bit strange that we didn't meet Izzy once - we like to choose our hosts based on their personal profile as well as the room listing so this was a bit disappointing. The lady who was there was very sweet and showed us where everything was but we didn't really click so we didn't spend much time at all in the communal areas. The room is spacious with plenty of natural light and was fairly clean, however there was a really loud vent that came on and off all the time, I'm not a particularly light sleeper but it often woke me and there were no ear plugs provided or option to turn it off as it heats the whole house. Overall we had a fine stay, it was a lot more like a bnb (without the breakfast) or a hostel than a home, but it was all ran professionally and other than the noise we had no real problems.",1
"Pleasant one night stay at Izzy's home. The bed was comfortable, the room (and house overall) was very clean, and directions for check-in were clear. Amazing value!",1
The apartment was cozy and clean and came with all the necessary utilities. The basement room also included a small heater and refrigerator. Overall a pleasant experience and would stay here again. ,1
"I had a great stay at Izzy's. The apartment is easy to access and the self check in was a breeze. The room was comfortable and private, and all the amenities were clean and organized. I had a lovely breakfast with Rosa, who made fresh bread, and the other guests. Definitely a great choice when traveling through Boston!",1
"The stay at Izzy's was just what I needed.  Communication was quick and easy, I was able to drop off my luggage early, the room was clean and as advertised.  Great location for me going to the airport and was able to immediately catch an Uber even at 4 in the morning.",1
"Very nice private room. For the price, it's unbeatable. Not really central, but close to T station (blue line). Nice clean bathroom, cozy space. Would stay again.",1
This was our second time stay although on a different room which turned out even better. There was so much privacy since the room is downstairs with a (URL HIDDEN)'t meet Izzy this time but Rosa was sweet and helpful too. Highly recommend this place.,1
"I had a great stay at Izzy's place. Izzy was quick and helpful in communication. The instructions for getting into the house and finding the room were very clear and worked, no problem. We locked ourselves out of our room at one point and the woman watching the house had a spare which was a relief.

The room and house were as described and very comfortable. I slept really well! The neighborhood was lovely and getting to and from the subway was very easy and convenient to the rest of Boston.",1
This was a cozy room with a comfortable bed. We felt very welcome. Great location if you're coming in from the airport. Izzy was really helpful.,1
"Host house was very clean and welcoming! Our room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. We were in Boston for Pax East this weekend, and so were away from the host home for a vast majority of the time. The neighborhood was quiet, with a nice park nearby which lead directly to public transit, and was only about a 36 minute commute to the convention center via bus. We hope to attend PAX again next year, and Izzy's place just might have to be our same choice!",1
"I arrived late at nite and did a self check-in, leaving early the next morning for a flight out of Logan. Everything was as described, no problems with the checkin-in or anything else. Perfect place to stay if you have an early morning flight.",1
"If you're looking for a clean, quiet place for a stopover in Boston near the airport, this is the place! I was quite pleased with my stay! Just minutes from the airport in a quiet, working class neighborhood dotted with great restaurants and markets. Our basement room was clean and quiet. The house was full but all the other guests were polite and friendly. The common areas were clean and inviting. Izzy provides quick and simple self check-in and check-out instructions. We walked to a great restaurant, Rino's, from Izzy's place. Great home base in Boston!",1
"Izzy's place was great. Good price, conveniently located, easy to find and get into.",1
It was amazing to stay in Izzy's place. The house was beautiful clean and organized! Highly recommended!,1
Great place to stay near the airport and easy to get downtown. The self check-in was perfect for us so we didn't have to disturb anyone getting in from a late flight. Izzy was great at responding to all of our questions and making the reservation for us. ,1
"Izzy wrote a welcoming message on the door of our room.  There are two other renters and it was enjoyable meeting and talking with them.   We never met or spoke with Izzy but talked with a women who tried her best to assist us but could not.  The room was fine but the experience was negatively affected by the difficult parking.  Most streets are two hours only unless you have a sticker.  We spent too much time trying to find nearby overnight parking and there was none. After much frustration, we finally located parking about 1/2 mile away.  We had use of the kitchen for breakfast, but the pots and pans for cooking were not as good as we might have liked.  In summary, the room was fine but the parking and kitchen made this a negative experience.",0
"Wonderful. Close to the airport and easy to get here. Lots of stores open even at night. Safe and quiet neighborhood, clean and comfortable bedroom. I really enjoy my stay in Boston.",1
We liked our stay even though it was just for one night. Very close to the airport. ,1
"Very close to the airport, clear directions. Nice one bedroom with bathroom upstairs. Host was efficient! An AC unit would have been helpful! ",1
"Great location, comfortable room, clean common areas, friendly guests, easy check-in. Not a five-star resort, but if you want a clean,  comfortable bedroom for the night it's great!",1
"Check-in/check-out was easy and it waa easy to get to the house from the metro station which took me only 5 mins or even less. The house was clean but only problem was that there was only one bathroom but other than, the house is a perfect place to stay. ",1
I was happy to find a sort of communal hostel upon my return from nine months of backpacking thru South America. There was no way I was going to stay in some awful franchise but I wanted something near the airport for a late night arrival after long international flights. I was very happy with my stay - the room was comfortable and the shared facilities were well organized and welcoming. Because I was jet lagged I went straight to bed but would have otherwise been interested in spending time with the other travelers staying here. Additionally there were a number of Salvadoran restaurants that looked  great - cheap and cheerful - so you can have tasty ethnic food just minutes from the door. The neighborhood is safe and friendly - it's a low income Hispanic residential section of town - and I enjoyed walking around smiling and waving to the locals sitting on their stoops.,1
"I spent three nights here and enjoyed my stay. I never saw the host, and there were other guests staying at the house. I don't think anyone actually lives here and the house is used for air bnb, but I'm not entirely sure. The location is super convenient to the airport and to the T that gives you access to the City of Boston. Family neighbourhood that was very quiet. The bed is super comfortable and the interent was great.  Izzy also kindly let me store luggage in the house during the day before my early evening flight.",1
"I was very thankful to find this place.  I was stranded over night in Boston, and this place was available and within walking distance of the airport (after the free shuttle ride to the train station). 

I never saw Izzy or anyone else. It's a little pricey for the quality, and smells like animal in one area, but it was exactly what I needed, when and where I needed it! ",1
"The house was easy to find from the airport train staton, just a quick walk through the park. On our first night we met friends for dinner and after dropping off our things, I noticed a sign on the park gates saying 'closed at 11 pm'. We had a bit of a rush to make it back in time and got off the T at 10.56! I am not sure how observant they are of the park closing times, but it's something to keep in mind. The basement room was clean, comfortable and private, which I appreciated. Having one bathroom for a house with 4 bedrooms meant that there was often a wait for the shower/ toilet, but we managed. There were plenty of Boston brochures and maps about the house for guests to use, which was handy, great to help us decide how to use our three days in town. The house was clean and welcoming, with the hand towel and bath mat seemingly changed daily. The shower did need a bit of a clean though the rest of the bathroom as spotless. we could have done with a towel rail or some kind of hooks on which to hang our towels in our room. Otherwise despite the heat, they could be slow to dry. We loved the fact it wa just 3 stops from the action, so getting in in the morning and home at night was such a simple and quick process. Very happy withour stay.",1
Super,1
"The house is clean and our room was just as described. It is very close to the metro station and only a few stops away from downtown. The instructions to get to the house from the airport were also very helpful and easy to follow. Izzy was very helpful with suggestions for things to do in Boston. We had the opportunity to interact not only with him but with his assistant Fabi and other gusts as well. Everyone was very nice and polite. If you're looking for a clean and affordable place to stay in Boston, Izzy 's place is definitely a good option. ",1
"Me and my wife rented this room for 1 night.Location was good, near to the airport. The room and common spaces were clean. I highly recommend.",1
"Property was easy to find, extremely clean, very safe, and convenient to the airport and rental car areas.  Much easier than staying at a hotel nearby for more money.  Izzy was very easy to reach and a great host!",1
"nothing what I expected !
we start from the position..the house is in a very bad boston district where there is nothing and there live exclusively Latinos (hispanic district) ! the metro is a 10 min walk but if you come back late at night you have to go for strength to a park where there are not recommended subjects . we had always come back soon because we were afraid something happened to us ! neighborhood dirty, ugly people , no restaurant !
as it regards the room was in the basement ... with a small WC designed in under 1 meter scale .
all very dirty and very poorly maintained.
nobody helped us by giving us indications
terrible experience .",0
"The house uses a self check-in way, the guest can follow the instruction  the host sends before arrival, it was easy and simple. The place is very clean, and we saw a shelf with all those clean towels. we stayed at the first floor, but since one has to go upstairs to get into the house, you have to go downstairs to get into this bedroom. But there are windows and light can get into the bedroom. 

The owner was not in the house, but there are stickers with instructions on them all over the house, so it was very convenient. The owner's friend also lives in that house, so she can help guests with what they need.",1
"My wife and I had a great experience while staying with Alex and Bob. The house is very organized and the room was great. Everything was very clean and the decoration was very beautiful. 
The neighborhood is nice and the house is near restaurants, pubs and markets where you can purchase whatever you need. The T is not far: about 15 minutes walking.
The hosts were caring and were always thinking about our necessities and about how they could make us comfortable. 
Alex and Bob are both great guys and our stay couldn't have been better!! Alex was our host during our stay. He's an amazing human being and was always there for us.
Thank you so much, guys.
I hope we can see you again soon.",1
Had a great time at Robert and Alex's place. The room is stylish and comfortable and the gardens are beautiful! Not far from the T. I enjoyed my stay and hanging out with Alex!,1
"We were welcomed by Rob on early arrival and he very helpfully allowed us to leave our luggage until check in time. This was much appreciated.

The room and facilities were excellent and were as they appeared on their website.  There is plenty of storage and hanging space, and the extra jets in the shower were very soothing after hard days walking!

We were able to use the kitchen facilities for breakfast and our evening meal and we also used their washing machine and dryer.

The 12 minute walk to the train station was fine in the day - we didn't come home after dark so can't make a comment on that. The location was not quite as we'd expected .   

There weren't many restaurants in close proximity although there were a couple of convenience stores close by.  ",1
"It was a first AirBnB experience for my girlfriend and I and honestly, we did not expect such a nice stay. Alex was a wonderful host and such a nice person! The room was perfectly clean with an AMAZING private bathroom.  The neighbourhood was nice and the train was not far from the condo (10 min walk). There are also other little surprises that made our stay very pleasant but enough spoilers! We highly recommend this bedroom rental.",1
Had a great experience!! Alex was a great host!! The premise was amazing and had a beautiful garden display!! We would not hesitate to stay again!! Thank you!! ,1
Alex and Bob's flat is decorated with attention to detail. Alex was a great host. We loved his messages.,1
"The place was wonderful - we had a beautifully-decorated & impeccably-kept private room, with a new-looking full bath, comfortable queen bed & full closet. Alex made sure he was there to greet us, & went out of his way to make us feel comfortable & welcome, with pre-printed maps to a great, walkable restaurant & the T stop - we used the T frequently to go all over Boston. He & Robert had snacks set out for us, & clearly take great pride in the condition & tasteful decorating of our room & the whole condo/townhouse.

My wife & I DEFINITELY recommend this place, & would ABSOLUTELY stay there again on our next trip to Boston!",1
"We stayed two nights with Bob and Alex and it could not have been better. They received us on Friday evening with a really beautiful home and a welcoming message posted on the fridge! :) Everything was perfectly arranged and every detail was taken care of. The bedroom and the house were really comfortable (we fall in love with the mattress!). The description is really accurate, everything is more than clean and it makes you feel at home. We will definitely be back. Totally recommended. ",1
"Alex was extremely helpful and accommodating. He gave us a map of the area, gave us suggestions for places to go out/restaurants, and even provided us with a Charlie card (to use for public transit)! 

The listing is just like the pictures: extremely clean, lovely, and pleasant all-around. Essentially, Alex keeps a nice home. 

I'd read online that Dorchester is a ""rougher"" part of Boston, so I asked Alex about this. He reassured me that as long as we stay on big streets, we'd be fine; I didn't at any point feel insecure in my safety. The neighborhood's cute and within walking distance of various restaurants. ",1
The room was nicely decorated and the bed very comfortable. We liked the walk-in closet and the huge bathroom.,1
"
Alex was a great host. His personal touches make you feel like you are right at home. The room is beautifully decorated and has everything you would need for your stay. I highly recommend staying with Alex!",1
"They are the nicest people I have ever met. We landed to Boston at around 1 am and then took uber to get to their place, but we told the driver wrong address, and we did not get to their place until like 3 am. But Alex was up and waiting for us to welcome. Room was simply amazing. No doubt  to give them five stars.",1
This is a great room with everything you need and more. The en suite bathroom is the best I've seen at an Airbnb. Would highly recommend.,1
Amazing home. Best place I have ever stayed Alex and Bob are amazing people  who are very kind and respectful  towards there guest. The home is in a great location  to get anywhere in the city fast. Did I mention it's gorgeous.,1
"Great place. Kind hosts. You've got your own entrance to your room and Alex (the host) respects your privacy, but if you want to go to the living room and interact with him, you'll find a kind guy to talk to.
The place is very clean, I mean very very clean. I had a lovely time staying there.",1
"ENGLISH
Me and my girlfriend returned from a 3 days stay at Alex and Bob. We were warmly welcomed by Alex who was able to properly advise us throughout our stay. The condo is beautiful and the room we occupied for three nights was very cozy. The bed is extremely comfortable and the ensuite bathroom includes a huge shower which is perfect after a tiring day of walking and visiting. The red line (Boston Subway) passes near the condo, which makes it easier to visit and travel from one part of the city to another. 

We had a small problem with our bikes rental with Hubway (the bike sharing system in Boston), but fortunately, Bob and Alex were kind enough to offer us their help and called the Hubway company, which helped a lot and saved us from wasting time making calls.

We are more than satisfied with our stay and recommend this Airbnb without any hesitation. We hope to return at Alex and Bob in the future. Thanks again guys and take care!

Moi et ma copine revenons d’un séjour de trois jours à Boston où nous avons eu la chance de rester dans le Airbnb de Alex et Bob. Nous avons été accueillis chaleureusement par Alex qui a d’ailleurs su bien nous conseiller tout au long de notre séjour. Le condo est absolument magnifique et la chambre que nous avons occupée était chaleureuse et douillette. Le lit est extrêmement confortable et la salle de bain attenante comprend une immense douche, ce qui a été particulièrement apprécié après nos journées à visiter et à se promener dans la ville. Le métro (red line) passe à proximité de la résidence, ce qui facilite grandement les déplacements vers le centre-ville et les autres secteurs de Boston. 

Nous avons eu un petit problème lors de la location de nos vélos avec la compagnie Hubway, mais heureusement, Alex et Bob ont eu la gentillesse de nous proposer leur aide. Ils ont appelé la compagnie, ce qui nous a évité de perdre du temps à faire des démarches par téléphone. 

Nous sommes plus que satisfaits de notre séjour et nous recommandons cet Airbnb sans aucune hésitation. Nous comptons retourner chez Alex et Bob lors de notre prochaine visite à Boston. Merci pour tout et au plaisir! :)",1
"Alex and Bob were absolutely awesome! From the very first contact with them, until the day I left, they made me feel that they cared about making my trip great. Both Alex and Bob where readily available through texting and calls if I needed them. Bob also texted me or called me several times during my trip to make sure that I was doing okay. I was a single, female, traveler in a big city, so I really appreciated him checking on me and making sure I was doing alright. Alex often asked me if I needed anything or if there was anything that needed refreshing in my room. The two of them anticipated the needs of a traveler and the room was set up great. The room was very clean and comfortable. Coffee readily available in the morning very important for this Traveler! They were also great in helping me know what the city had to offer and all the cool places to visit. They had maps printed out and available for local restaurants that are within walking distance as well as directions to the nearest T Station. I can't say enough about these two hosts. They made my stay even better than I anticipated and when I come back to Boston, if they are available, I will definitely book with them again. I highly recommend their place!",1
"My wife and I could not have asked for a better experience than we had with Alex (and Bob), both were outstandingly accommodating and made us feel as if we were at home. Every morning Alex had breakfast items laid out for us and coffee ready to brew, along with delicious fresh baked coconut chocolate cookies and banana bread brownies. The room we stayed in was perfectly kept, all our amenities were provided, and the shower is just something you will have to see for yourself! Alex was very personable (and so was Bob) to talk top and we enjoyed all our conversations, and he even gave us some great pointers on improving our green thumb (he is an exceptional gardener). If you want to give the non-traditional tourist trip to Boston, then Alex and Bob are the perfect people to get you started; from restaurant recommendations and attractions to understanding the public transportation and local history, they make sure you are taken care of every step of the way. If we ever come back to Boston, we know where we'd want to stay.",1
"Alex was very nice and made us feel right at home!! Even though we only stayed a night, it was a very nice experience! ",1
"We were very fortunate to find Alex and Bobs home! It was the perfect spot, we had our own mini apartment inside their home with an amazing shower! We parked our car with no problem in their parking lot overnight which was very convenient.  Alex was a great host laying out a breakfast spread for us in the morning. Nothing but praises, would come back again when visiting Boston. ",1
My wife and I had a great stay with Alex & Bob!  Alex was a gracious host.  All communication was thorough and timely.  The room was comfortable/cozy and immaculate - Both the host & place made for a wonderful stay... When we return to Boston we'll be sure to seek out this spot!  Thanks so much Alex!,1
"This is my best Airbnb experience. The bedroom is beautiful and cozy, with comfortable bed and sofa. The bathroom is clean and the shower is amazing! Alex (and Bob) is communicative. They even prepare public transit cards for us. I will definitely choose them again when I come back to Boston.",1
"An amazing place! We loved it. The shower was the best part about the room. It was huge! Everything else was awesome too. Nice bright colors and super clean.
Alex helped us out a lot! When we got there he printed out tour guides and info about the transportation in the city. When we had to leave Boston, we had a super early flight in the morning. I just mentioned that we had to leave early and he offered to take us, without hesitation. We haven't been on Airbnb long but this one place made our whole trip. Alex and Bob are the best! Thank you so much for all the hospitality!",1
"I love this place so much. Bob and Alex are very gracious and friendly, who helped us a lot. The bedroom is cozy, beautiful, clean, and neat. The best thing about the room is the shower which I really love it. Also, Bob and Alex communicate with us every time. If I have the second time, I definitely will choose to live with them again.",1
"We stayed with Alex (and Rob) for a week on a holiday. Before we arrived Alex was helpful to make sure we would be able to find the place. The location is quite convenient. A 10-15 minute walk will get you to the metro that takes you to downtown Boston in less than 15 minutes. 
Upon arrival Alex was there to welcome us and could always be reached if we needed anything. The room and the adjacent private bathroom were really nice and clean, just like how it is shown on the pictures. We had good nights of sleep on the comfortable bed and there was hardly any noise from outside. The room is nicely decorated and has a big TV. Wifi is also accessible and of good quality. 
We were allowed to use the kitchen and Alex made space in the fridge available for us. There was fresh coffee when we wanted.
Both Alex and Rob are very friendly people and are nice to talk to. 
We would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston. Next time we visit Boston we would certainly go for their place again!
",1
Alex and Bob were real nice. Their place was beautiful and even bigger than it looked in the pictures. Alex was real nice to let us know how to use the T and was super friendly. We had a great stay thanks to him :),1
"Alex & Bob were fantastic hosts. When we arrived, Alex was outside working in the yard, and greeted us with a warm smile & showed us the space. He gave us great advice on how to get on the subway, use Boston's public transit with ease, and gave us great tips on places nearby to eat. Our room was extremely clean and comfortable, which had complimentary bottled water, basket of beach goodies, and travel size toiletries in the bathroom for travelers to use. Alex and Bob have done an exceptional job at making this space complete with everything you might need during your stay. We loved our time here in Boston! Thank you Alex & Bob! ",1
"Great room, perfect hosts. very clean and quiet, close to JFK/UMass T line and easy to get into the city. Stayed for 5 days while attending conference at Boston Convention Center and had a great time!",1
Alex and Bob were very easy to deal with. Loved the space and the shower was fantastic. Anything we needed was there. Would refer this place to any one.,1
"It was comfortable and quite stay, like a home. Particularly the beautiful garden and the deducted parking space!",1
"When we arrived Alex was super welcoming! The place is super clean and comfy! It felt like being in an upscale yet home-y feeling condo...the room was beautiful and the bathroom and shower were spacious as well. We had a walk in closet, tv, desk, wifi, free parking spot and so much more that made our stay effortless and smooth. Alex was always there to answer questions if we had any or answered our messages very quickly. We would absolutely consider staying here again, we loved it! As soon as we walked into our room and met Alex we knew what a super host meant and how much he merits that title! Thanks for a great couple of days! ",1
he was very welcoming and warm !1,1
"Alex went out of his way to welcome me, considering I had scheduled to arrive at 11:30 pm and I showed up an hour later. On Saturday am Alex was kind enough to brew coffee for me and even lend me a special personal handbag for my walk-able tour of Boston. 

Alex was well prepared with all the touring and transportation info I needed, there is even a load of pamphlets and brochures neatly placed in the room for the guest use.

The bathroom had a wide range of shampoos and soaps to choose from, towels neatly cleaned and lavender fresh. 

The neighborhood is very quiet and the windows appeared to be are very well insulated for sound, that along with the comfort and quality of bedding made for a perfect night rest.  The temperature within the room was also very pleasant with just the right touch of cool and very mild humidity.",1
"We stayed here for 3 nights and everything was perfect. Alex is really helpfull and welcoming. The house is beautiful, clean and big. Our room was big, so it was the bathroom with everything you may need( towels, differente beauty products and a big shower). Alex also have su the Charlie card and helped us with the sightseeing!
You also have Wi-Fi and a private parking spot!",1
"Room is as pictured.

In many air bnb's the spare room is just an after thought but Alex and Bob have put a lot of care into creating a cosy and welcoming space that is done to a high standard; beautiful hardwood floors, extremely comfortable bedding, large walk-in shower with power jet options and nice soft towels! Curtains are black out thickness so I slept very peacefully. 

The whole room and en-suite bathroom were exceptionally clean. There is a side entrance to the apt that opens by the room so it gives a sense of privacy when coming and going.

Only saw Alex briefly as I was mostly out but he was very pleasant and welcoming.

Would absolutely stay here again!",1
"Alex and (Bob) were great hosts! When we arrived, Alex was there to greet us and provided a tour of the condo. The room was very well-kept and clean. The bathroom was extremely clean and spa-like. Alex also provided us with a quick rundown of the MBTA system and a basket of brochures with recommended activities to do in Boston. We enjoyed our stay at Alex (and Bob's) condo and would recommend anyone visiting to stay at their place!",1
"Giulio's roommate Nikolai was friendly and accommodating when my arrival was delayed by an hour due to my train being delayed, and he graciously allowed me to leave my luggage in the apartment until the evening on the day of my departure. The room was clean and comfortable with linens provided. The streets of Beacon Hill are a bit difficult to navigate with rolling luggage, but the neighborhood is beautiful. I would gladly stay with Giulio/Nikolai in the future.",1
Great place to stay. Giulio and Niko were very accommodating and flexible with check-in/out. The room was very comfortable.. Despite the apartment being shared it was an extremely private stay. I highly recommend this place!,1
"Giulio was a great host. Although we had little time to chat, he was very friendly and responsive to my questions. The room is comfy for one person and the neighborhood is one of the nicest in Boston.
Will definitely be back!",1
"Sergio has a lovely and artistic home. The ambiance of his place is very inspiring and relaxing.

His friend John was an amazing help and his great personality made the experience better!

The neighborhood has everything you need within a 2-10 minute walk: restaurants, subway, mall, wholefoods, park, cafes and great architecture!  ",1
"Sergio was a fantastic host.  He is warm, friendly, accommodating, and very responsive to any questions over text message.  He even gave us his neighbor's phone number in the building in case we needed anything!  The place was in a fantastic location, very close to the T (subway) and bus lines, close to Fenway park and some bars and restaurants.  

The apartment was really comfortable and clean, and very very cutely decorated.  He was kind enough to allow us to use his desktop computer even as we had traveled without one.  

He also left extra blankets for us as it was a very very unusually cold weekend.  :-)

The place felt very safe as there is a separate keyed entry to the building in addition to the lock on the apartment.  It was quiet in the building.  

We really enjoyed our stay!  Thank you Sergio!",1
"Sergio is a fantastic host ! 
We had a great marathon weekend in Boston and one of highlights was having the chance to stay in a great location and in a very comfortable, organized and neat apartment.
Sergio also received us with our favorite Brazilian dish which was spectacular and also made himself available during the whole stay. Thanks! Highly recommend!!",1
Sergio was a fantastic host. Our flight was delayed and we got in extremely late. His friend Heraldo was so sweet to stay up late for us! Sergio was wonderful with helping with the communication that we would be very late.  The place was amazing and so clean! Very close to Fenway for us to see Pearl Jam. We had a fantastic time!,1
"Location is phenomenal.  Host was super friendly, excellent with communication, and a pleasure to rent from.  Apartment had everything we needed.  5 star all the way. ",1
"Nathaniel was more than willing to accommodate a special request I had. The place was great! It was clean, in a great location, no problems at all. 10/10 would visit again.",1
Great centrally located apartment.  ,1
Everything was as expected from the listing. Nathaniel was easy to contact and followed up with us as necessary. ,1
"Thank you Nathaniel for welcoming me into your home.  It was everything as advertised and more.  Clean, quaint and a great location for rest at the end of a couple of very, very long work days near by.   I for one enjoyed the personal meet and greet.  ",1
"Great place near the Boston Common, good and quick communication with Nathaniel, all was good!",1
"The apartment is in a very convenient location. It's nice, clean, and spacious. The room is on the 8th floor with a great view of Boston Common Park. I booked this room for my dad and he really likes this place.",1
Nathaniel was very responsive and very helpful. The apartment is great in a fantastic location and I can recommend it to everybody who is staying in Boston for a break!,1
This apartment is exactly as described and was perfect for myself and a couple family members. Christine is an excellent communicator with a noticeable love of her city and care for her home. The place has a fully equipped kitchen and living room with a great printed guide to the home and neighborhood and a small widescreen TV in the bedroom. It sort of has a cottage feel in the big city. There is no elevator however there are 2 flights of narrow stairs to navigate. The neighbors are nice and extremely quiet and the building is well maintained and safe. My family and I loved our stay 100%!,1
"We had an excellent stay at Christine's apartment. The apartment is very spacious for the city, clean, and has an amazing large bathroom. She also has a nice flat screen TV with VCR/DVD player. The process was very easy to stay with her. The location of the apartment is perfect, close to both the subway and bus system, is on a side street with little traffic, and a half block from a very nice park. The stay was wonderful!! ",1
"The apartment and location are perfect, with plenty of nearby shops and cafes. It's a perfect location to explore the entire city.",1
"Even though Christine was overseas during my stay, her warmth and sense of welcome was so abundantly clear in the emails that I felt like she was not far away at all.  Her home is lovely--feels quite European in fact, so visitors from across the Atlantic would feel right at home.

The neighborhood is beautiful -- restaurants and coffee shops and parks within a couple of blocks. 

She responded to correspondence with lightning speed.  I had to figure a lot of things out before booking, and she was incredibly patient through that process.

A very generous host who was very kind and flexible about checkout times and insisted that I make myself at home!
",1
"One of the most gracious hosts I've met on Airbnb. The place was in gorgeous, quaint and the location was perfect in the south end",1
"Christine was the perfect host - helpful before and during our stay. She left abundant maps and recommendations for us to use during our stay, so needless to say she was extremely helpful. The flat itself is elegant and charming (the picture doesn't do it justice), and is located in a beautiful neighbourhood in the south end of Boston. It's a stone's throw away from loads of great restaurants, and is also just about walking distance to the town centre. There's a bus near by if you're not up for the walk!",1
"Christine was incredibly helpful and generous. She provided a lot of helpful information before I had even left home, and then called me to be sure I had reached her apartment safely. The neighborhood was lovely and the apartment just as described. It was very clean, comfortable, and charming, with all the amenities. She checked in during my stay to be sure everything was going well, and even let me leave my bags there on my last day. I highly recommend her as a host, and would be happy to stay in her place again next time I visit Boston. ",1
"I really enjoyed staying at Christine's lovely apartment!  I was there for a week attending a conference at the Boston Convention and Expo Center, and Christine gave me very clear and easy directions from her apartment to the Convention Center.  She was very communicative before I arrived, and checked in with me via email during the week to make sure everything was OK.  She was very generous and helpful, and I will definitely stay here again next time I'm in Boston!  The neighborhood is very historical with lots of character - way better than a generic hotel!",1
"Judith kindly accommodated a late request for a place in Boston. Things worked out great. The location was ideal, with the waterfront and the Italian North End right there. The room itself faces into an interior atrium (not directly outside). It's plenty roomy, although not yet fully furnished. I knew this going in, and expect that Judith will do great things with the space. Pictures of the interior would have been helpful when I was ""shopping.""",1
Awesome place right in the middle of the north end of Boston. Within walking distance of all the historical sites.,1
"Judith's place was in a great location and she made sure that I had everything I needed! My train coming into Boston prevented me from meeting with her when we originally planned and she was more than accommodating in terms of re-scheduling out meet up. Overall, cool building in an even cooler location! It was a great experience!",1
"Great location, easy to book, wonderful communication with the host.  ",1
"The North End is a fantastic neighbourhood- many food options, close to everything in the city, close to the harbor.
Apartment 4 was tidy and cosey, however the wifi did not work and the sofa bed was rickety making it difficult to relax on.
All in all a very basic apartment, suitable for people who need only somewhere to sleep and shower.",0
"The apartment is not really big but nice and bright. The owner provides all utensils in the kitchen for guest to cook. The beds are soft and we all feel well sleeping on them.  And there are a lot of Italian restaurant around so we shall have delicious food during the two days. In addition, many gelateria are available near the apartment. The only thing that should be concerned is : the password of the Internet on the guidebook is incorrect, I called the hot line and the one on the phone said she will fix it on the following morning. However, when my friends and I came back to the apartment in the evening, the problem had not been solved. Anyway, we do enjoy our trip in Boston and staying in this apartment.  ",0
"Everything was perfect! The apartment is beautiful, clean, cozy and has all the facilities you may need, including blow dryer! The location is a plus. Right next to North End's main street (Hanover St), which has tons of nice italian restaurants, and less than 10 min walk to the T (Haymarket Station). My parents and I loved it!",1
"Compact, clean and secure apartment in the North End, exactly what were looking for.  Checking in out of hours was really easy and communication was great, would recommend.
",1
This appartment was perfect and cozy.  The location was ideal for our needs and the public parking was 2 minutes walk from the appartment.  Many restaurants and a small grocery store nearby the appartment.  We enjoyed our stay! thanks!,1
"We got our exercise, that's for sure.  The apartment building is a block off the Freedom Trail and a block and a half from Paul Revere's house - a great take-off spot to city some of Boston's most famous landmarks.  And with the apartment being on the fourth floor, that helps too.  The place was clean, the beds comfortable - a nice place to call home for our 4 day visit.
Located in the middle of North Boston, we were minutes away from an incredible selection of restaurants, coffee shops, and Mike's Pastry - don't miss it.  If you enjoy improvisation or comedy, the Improv Asylum is a fun and inexpensive thing to do 7 nights a week and just three blocks away.
The apartment is only six blocks from the ""T"" - Boston's metro system that will get you anywhere in the city, so don't rent a car.  Parking on the North end is not easy or inexpensive.  Just use the public transportation or take a cab, which are plentiful.
I would recommend this spot.",1
This place was very clean and SUPER location.  Easy to pick up keys and great directions given.   Very happy with the whole experience!,1
The instruction was complicated but overall was okay. They process of getting & returning the key took us some time. ,0
"The app was cleaned up and very well located. The kitchen has everything you need, the couch was comfy and the Wifi was fast. A nice app for vacation! We really enjoyed staying there! 

From the North End it is easy and comfortable to travel to all the different sights in Boston - downtown as well as Cambridge.",1
"The neighborhood is great, and the apartment is very well-kept. The only thing we were a little surprised about is that, in Boston's North End, the apartment doesn't have any wine glasses in it :o)",1
A great property in a fantastic location. Perfect for us and far better than a hotel. The property was a good size and had all the amenities that we needed. Good value in a city that has expensive lodging options. Would absolutely recommend.,1
"Great location! Apartment is clean, well-stocked, and comfortable. Wifi, appliances, and fixtures worked well. The process for getting/returning keys is a bit of a hassle, but worth it. It mentions that it is ""4th fl."" but should really mention a warning about the stairs. There are a lot of them and they are steep. Wouldn't recommend it if you are out of shape, elderly, or have small children. Overall a very pleasant place to stay.",1
This is a beautiful little apartment in the historic North End of Boston.  It's close to Hanover Street and only steps from the Freedom Trail.  ,1
The apartment was as advertised. It was clean and comfortable. The location is great and easy to walk anywhere. ,1
"Nice place in a lovely neighborhood. Dror and his staff were very kind, professional and so helpful before and during our stay.  Easy check-in and check-out. The apartment is pretty basic but functional and clean - located in the heart of the North End, very close to many lovely places, shops and restaurants. Be aware that it is a historical building and there is no elevator, so if you book apt. #4 (4th floor) I suggest to travel with no heavy baggage.
Overall this was a positive experience. 
Elvia",1
We liked the apartment but not the three flights of steps to get to it. ,0
"The location is great, with very nice Italian restaurants in the neighborhood. Though we didn't meet with Dror in person, he responded quickly. I would highly recommend this place to family and friends who would like to visit Boston.",1
"Dror appartment is very welcoming, and situated in a peaceful street nearby Hanover, which makes it the perfect place to stay in Boston.

It is also 20min walks from financial district, and was great for our business trip.

Everything was clean and ready to use, thanks a lot for providing such a nice place to the community and having set up such an easy way to manage logistic (keys,...)",1
"This place was charming and in a fantastic neighborhood for cafes, nightlife, delicious food and in walking distance to public transportation. Dror also provides a place for you to store your luggage for early arrival/late departure, which was convenient and appreciated. I would most definitely stay here again.",1
"Reliable key pick-up arrangements, top floor flat hard work to drag suitcases up to (but we knew that). Welcome pack enough for a meal or two available on arrival was appreciated. Minimal air conditioning just about coped in 34degC temperatures, but toilet plumbing failed on our last evening and we've had no apology for that. As made clear, the location is everything with this flat, right in Little Italy but hidden away round a quiet corner from the busyness of Hanover Street. Also very convenient for the short, easy walk to most tourist attractions downtown.",1
"Great location. Apartment is somewhat small, although very comfortable and the neighborhood is nice, with an old-european style.",1
Everything was great - as described and expected.,1
We liked the central location of this apartment and its charm.,1
"20 Moon Street in Boston's North End was everything we were hoping it would be.  Very clean, comfortable and convenient ... our vacation to Boston was made that much better because of our accommodations. We love visiting cities and feeling like we live there and 20 Moon Street made us feel like we were at home in another city. The location can't be beat! 10 minutes from the airport. The restaurants, shops and sites in the North End all seemed to be within a few minutes walk. 10 minute walk to Quincy Market and waterfront attractions. We had no trouble getting anywhere in the city we wanted to go. We will definitely be staying here again on future visits to the city.  Dror's listing and hospitality were exactly as advertised and then some.  ",1
"It was one of the best my airbnb experiences. Karin was sweet! The room is nice, the kitchen is very well furnished (was happy to use Greek ibrik for making coffee every morning), the district is safe and beautiful (hills are good for running). I made my 'last-minute' booking and was delighted with that choice. And Karin's cats are super cool!",1
"Staying at Karin's was great!  It was exactly like I expected from the photos.  The room was clean, towels were laid out for me and there were two sweet kitties to greet me.  Karin made me feel very welcome, she respected my privacy and was a great resource as far where to explore while I was there.  The neighborhood was pleasant, quiet and very close to a large park.  I highly recommend staying with Karin if you can.  ",1
"Karin was the perfect hostess for me.  While respecting my privacy, she made me feel welcome. The room was just as I expected, and I had everything I needed.  When I came in on my last night, I heard the theme from Downton Abbey playing on Karin's TV, and she graciously invited me to watch the show with her; much appreciated! And I enjoyed the cats, too.

"I spent 3 days while in Boston at Karin's place. It is a lovely house with all you need, the room was perfect, clean and really comfy bed. The check in was super easy and well organized. Having everything I needed.
The location is fantastic 5/10 minutes walk to the train station (T) that it takes less than 15 minutes to City Centre. (Try the Mexican restaurant at Amory St., before going back home, you wont regret it). Karin was really helpful providing advice and suggestions for my stay in Boston. 
I highly recommend staying at Karin's place, I will stay again if I find myself visiting Boston again.",1
Karin was a wonderful host and very helpful. Her home was well kept and the bed was very comfortable. She made me feel welcome and it was easy to get in touch with her to find the place. The listing pictures and description are accurate and it was easy to get around from her location. I would definitely book with her again! I highly recommend her for girls travelling alone. :),1
"I had a very pleasant stay with Karin. The house is beautiful, the cats are adorable, the neighborhood is good and Karin is a very welcoming and friendly woman.",1
"Overall, a great room in a comfortable apartment and amazing location.",1
"I came to Boston for two weeks with my girlfriend and the appartment couldn't have been better. It was cozy and very comfortable, it has an small kitchen where we coocked daily and the building was very quite.
The neighbourhood was beautiful and safety with quiet restaurants. The subway (green line) was a 10 min walk but most days we just went walking as Boston is very easy to go walking everywhere.
Walter was very nice with us, he gave us some recomendations and was very attentive to out needs so we definetly recommend this appartment.",1
"Great neighborhood, nice efficiency apartment with everything I needed. Walter was extremely attentive to all my needs and concerns. ",1
"Perfect place and nice neighborhood.
",1
"Everything was great! Clean, great location, every amenity provided for, and steps away from everything you need. Will definitely visit again - hopefully this time next year!",1
"Great and awesome!! Everything thing is brand new!! Location is fine, you will love to train for this city!!!We had a wonderful time with this team!!",1
Great modern apartment in a central location. Nice decor though living room / kitchen area is fairly small ,1
"Very clean, spacious, comfortable, and well-located.  Staff also was extremely responsive to all my questions, both before and after I committed to rent.",1
"This is the second time that I have stayed in a Flatbook property and I would gladly do so again. The apt is in a small building in an area near BU. It is close to the T, barely a 3 minute walk from the Green Line, on a side street. There are 2 Starbucks nearby, as well as a good grocery store. Lots of restaurants and bars in walking distance. Everything in the apt is set for the user, rather than being the host's space. The service, and communication for check-in is excellent. In the price range it was an excellent choice. Very pleased. ",1
Very clean and well serviced apartment. Everything was in order and as expected.,1
"easy to book, fantastic team, unbelievable stay...
thank you! The apartment couldn't have been any better: incredible location, clean, bright, spotless and super comfy! Pictures were great but they don't do justice to the apartment itself!!!!!

Kitty was super helful, everybody was nice and kind...
we'll be coming back and recommend it to all our friends!",1
"Excellent apartment, great location. I gave 4 stars because it was a bit pricey, but otherwise there's no issues.",1
We had a very nice stay.,1
"Perfect location! Easy access to the T, in a beautiful neighborhood, close to MGH. The apartment was easy to find and there was guest street parking available a couple of short blocks away. Very clean and homey. Checking in/out was seamless and Christian was very easy to get in touch with. ",1
"I planned this trip to Boston as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday and Christian's apartment was absolutely perfect for us! The location is so convenient to everything.  We had two events to attend at TD Garden and we were able to walk over there in only  about 10-15 minutes.  To get anywhere else we jumped on the T just up the street from the apartment which made things so easy.  
As for the apartment itself, it was very cozy and gave us the feel of what it would be like to live in the city.  We have no complaints whatsoever although, I do feel it's worth noting that the staircase in the building is narrow and steep and the bathroom is also very small since the building is old.  We found the historical feel of the building cool but neither of us is particularly big/tall so it may not be as comfortable for someone of larger stature. That being said, we found the apartment to be phenomenal.  We would definitely love to stay there again.
Not only was the place great, Christian was also the ideal host.  We didn't get to meet him in person but he was so pleasant through all our communication, was quick to respond to any questions I had, and even went the extra mile by offering us detailed recommendations for his favorite spots near the apt and around Boston.  
Thank you Christian for being so accommodating and making our first Airbnb experience a great one!!     ",1
"Christian is a perfect, laid back host and will help you make things work despite your crazy schedule. 

The apartment is perfectly located, within one block of the metro and within a few minutes walking from plenty of wining & dining options (Christian left a great list of recommendations)",1
"First of all, Chirstian is a stand-up guy. He was very communicative the whole time, and even though I never met him, he seems to be an incredibly nice person. The apartment is very cozy with all the amenities; perfect for 1-2 people. It's in the best location in Boston; Beacon Hill is a beautiful neighborhood. Also it's one block from the T which was very convenient!",1
"I can only say positive things. Christian was very helpful even though we never met. He is obviously a great guy. Very friendly, sent us a list of places to go and even brought us a Red Sox cap and left beers in the fridge for us! Even when we had a little mishap and accidentally shorted the power he was quick to reply and directed us expertly with how to resolve the problem! Easy fix and smooth running after that! The apartment was as described and I think better than the pictures on here. Lovely old building. I adored the location and it was easy to get around. Honestly a perfect little getaway. Just what we needed. I can't say enough about it! I would recommend to anyone visiting Boston either for a short weekend away or a longer time. I have also never slept so well! I would give this places a 50 stars if I could! I would love to stay again. Thanks for everything Christian! ",1
"Christian was a great host! Although we never met, he left a list of instructions and a list of things to do. His place in beacon hill was on a lovely, quaint street and the apartment was very clean, and accessible to the train as well as walking most places. We walked almost everywhere except Fenway which was an easy ride on the T! ",1
Helpful host. Apartment in good location.,1
Christian made getting the keys to the place very easy.  He also sent a page of basic instructions and a page of local area recommendations.  The place was clean and the basics were provided.  The location was phenomenal and easy to find.  ,1
"Christian proved to a great host. He provided us with beers and soda in the fridge, towels and shampoo, and gave us great advice on where to go to hang out. The apartment itself was fairly old and small, with the bathroom located in the building's stairwell. However, the location really made up for the less-than-ideal shape of the apartment (2 blocks away from John Kerry's home). Christian provided a level of service that was better than your average hotel, and I'd be happy to stay in his place again.",1
"Great place! Made me feel right at home. Christian was an awesome host! If I ever visit Boston again, He'll be the first place I look to stay. I Highly recommend! ",1
"Christian is really nice and friendly!!The location of this apartment is really wonderful! It close to subway and this old street is beautiful and safe~ The room is warm and sweet,just like a real home. I hope I can live in here again when I visit Boston again~",1
"Very well located. Comfortable and quiet at night when it counts. Having said that, there was a layer of dust and dirt on everything, we have stayed in enough Air BNB and VRBO places to know this was not professionally cleaned. We have also stayed in many European style places but this bathroom was the least practical we have ever encountered. It was nearly impossible to take a shower and the toilet was in the hallway.  Christian was very nice, I would recommend this place for the location alone. 
",1
"Christian provided a great experience. The apartment was clean and easy to access. He made checking in very convenient for me. The neighborhood was my favorite part, just steps to a great street with shopping and restaurants and I felt very safe. Thanks!",1
Christian was great!  He answered all our questions throughout our stay and new the city very well. Best of all he left us a list of a handful of places to go to which were described as well.  This was our first time using Airbnb and we couldn't be happier with the experience.,1
Christians place was great! He was very helpful and responsive when questions arised. He left us a red sox baseball hat to welcome us to the city and also have us tips and ideas for places to eat and explore. I would recommend this place to anyone! ,1
"As others have said, the location is great.  I found the place to feel like the bachelor pad I guess it is.  The bed was really comfortable. It was clean and tidy.  The bathroom is a bit awkward but workable:  you have to go out in the hallway and it is TINY!  A great buy. 
",1
"The apartment was very clean, the location couldn't have been better; walking distance to everything, very cute neighborhood. Greg responded quickly to messages and was very helpful. Oh, and the deck/outdoor space was fantastic :)",1
"Great place to visit, highly recommended! There was a countless number of things to do, great night life and most importantly Fenway park. ",1
"Greg was a good host. He was quick to answer any questions that I may have and was always friendly and professional. The space was nice, a little small, but very cozy. The private patio was a plus. The historic neighborhood is always friendly and quiet. Not a far walk to the ferry that will take you downtown Boston. Or a little longer walk over the scenic bridge. I will definitely stay here again, when I visit next. If available!",1
"Overall a very good air bnb experience. The one issue we had was that the window sills and a lot of the tables/desks and bedroom bench were dusty and there were quite some bugs and tiny house spiders and spider webs, but not a big problem as it just requires a little more thorough cleaning. The beds, sheets, and bathrooms were very clean. Greg is also very quick to respond to messages and the apartment is easily accessible through cab and public transportation.  ",1
"Greg is an attentive host whose home I would highly recommend. Upon reaching out to him regarding needing last minute housing during Comic Con weekend in Boston, he promptly turned around a response within one to two hours. The quaint private deck is a small space that is ideal for reading one of the classic books he leaves on the living room ledge. The space comfortably sleeps 3 with the air bed included.",1
Greg was a great host during our weekend trip to Boston. The apartment is in a great location. We primarily walked during our trip and was able to find and walk to where we needed within a reasonable distance.  We completely fell in love with the neighborhood and would definitely stay at Greg's for our next visit. ,1
"Greg was a great host. The arrival and departure process was very easy and smooth. The place is exactly as expected from looking at the pictures, and located in a very nice area of Boston, quiet but still close to the places we wanted to go to. I would certainly return to Greg's apartment next time I go to Boston.",1
"the location is convenient. close to the green line.
the room was fine, but you have to get ready to share the bathroom with other long-term rent people, and clean it after you use it.",0
"Helena is very nice willing to offer you assistance when needed. The room is very spacious with a comfortable queen-size bed. Overall, my stay in Boston was fantastic and I truly appreciated her hospitality.",1
"The room was perfect and everything was as described. Helena was a great host, much better than average. I highly recommend staying at her place.",1
"Very friendly and helpful host. 
The room is spacious and clean. 
So far my best airbnb stay!",1
"The apartment was very nice and comfortable, and it was in a great part of the city.  We couldn't have asked for a better weekend getaway.",1
The appartment was perfect! Thank you!,1
"I'd recommend it.  The place was nice, clean, and in a great location.  There were some minor issues (that didn't have to do with the apartment), but Seamless was very helpful.   ",0
"The apartment was clean and in an amazing location.
We had some issues not related to Seamless Transition and they were very kind and accommodating.",1
"Our experience renting and staying in Boston was excellent.  The location on Beacon Street was perfect - very easy walk to everything, relatively quiet, and unit was very clean and accommodating.  The reasons for 4 stars rather than 5 are - place a little smaller than anticipated, but I guess that is City living; the unit was on the 5th floor and although the building had an elevator it didn't fit 2 adults, 2 kids and a stroller; and, the building façade was under construction so it blocked any views and sun light.  However, I would do again and would use this service.  ",0
"This 2BR was is a fantastic location.  About a block from the Make Way for Ducklings statues in the Public Gardens.  The unit is small, but as expected in a city like Boston.  It is very nicely equipped and was clearly recently renovated.  The elevator is a plus given that it was on the fifth floor of the building.  Check in and check out was very easy.",1
"Great apartment with plenty of room. We were a party of 4 adults and had plenty of space. Great set up with comfy beds, towels and all the luxuries of a hotel without the price tag. Great communication and would definitely stay here again. A little gem!! ",1
"We had a great stay and enjoyed our time in Boston.  And the location was PERFECT.  The apartment is clean and very functional.

I would stay there again but future guests should be aware that:

1.  The WiFi is a pain... it kicks you off every hour or so and you have to completely log back in again via your email address and a password.  Seems really unnecessary.

2.  The 2nd bedroom does not have any sort of heating or cooling.  So in order to keep it somewhat cool (in summer) you have to leave the door open and the window (there is a strange window between the 2nd bedroom and the living room) open.  Not a problem in many situations for families but we were two couples and it made the sleeping arrangements a bit awkward.  It is MUCH better than just a sleeper couch in the living room, but effectively not as private as you would expect from a 2nd bedroom.  But given the old nature of the building and the location of the 2nd bedroom, there's not an easy fix for the owner,

Again, don't let the two issues above deter you... we had a great stay and the location is amazing.
",0
"Brilliant location in proximity to so many attractions and transport.  To suggest that the apartment is spacious in the promotion of the property is perhaps an exaggeration. The kitchen is well appointed but the 2 bedrooms are very cramped.  Overall, we enjoyed our short stay.",1
"Excellent apartment. Very clean, great location, has everything you need. ",1
"Apartment is small, but was well located and fitted the four of us in for a few nights in Boston. The kitchen is well stocked with utensils and the bathroom looked fairly modern. With a stroller to get up to the fifth floor we were very grateful for the small elevator. ",1
Great apartment. Not huge but fine. Great location.,1
Great location and great place to stay. Spent two nights here for work and would definitely come back in the future.,1
"Everything worked perfect, from checkin to chekout. The apartment was clean and comfortable and located perfectly for sightseeing in Boston. Me and my friends really enjoyed our stay!",1
The name seamless says it all. The whole process couldn't have been easier or more pleasant. The apartment was in an amazing location and was clean and very comfortable to say in.  There are two wall units for AC which was completely sufficient to cool the entire apartment. We were extremely happy with our experience and will definitely consider staying there again during our next trip to Boston. ,1
"Awesome place, nicer than the pictures, super clean and the AC was on when we got it (was 90 outside!)",1
"The apartment was even better then the pictures, very comforatable and nice. check-in was very easy and the apartment was clean and had plently of amentities (bathroom supplies, towels, soap). would recommend this location and apartment to anyone who is looking for a place to stay in boston.",1
"Excellent location, good sized two bedroom apartment, kitchen had everything you need. Overall would definitely stay here again!",1
We had a fantastic stay in Boston. Apartment presented exactly like the photos and the location is just perfect for exploring Boston. It was straight forward to check in and I would not hesitate to stay again if i was to return to Boston.,1
"Seamless was really great about communication with my family. The location is absolutely perfect and close to everything! It's a little noisy from the road, and the air condioner kept fluctuating. The bathroom shower curtain looked like maybe mold was growing on it. But other than that it was a good place to stay in!",1
"Seamless was easy to work with and very responsive. The apt was clean, spacious, and in walking distance to dining, shopping, and nightlife. We would stay here again. ",1
"Vanessa's home is perfectly suited to be just outside of the busier parts of town but an easy bus or subway ride that prevents you from having to deal with Boston traffic!  There's even a group of shops and local restaurants within walking distance that serve incredible food at reasonable prices if you want to get breakfast or dinner before or after a day traveling around town.  Though we were in and out at odd hours, Vanessa was highly accommodating to even such an awkward schedule.   Next time I visit Boston, I wouldn't hesitate to ask to stay at her residence once again!",1
"Vanessa house is located in a nice and quiet neighbourhood, at a walkable distance from T train. Better love cats as Vanessa have 3! Home settings are basic, might fit expectations for a simple crash and sleep spot.",1
"Excellent experience! The room, bathroom, kitchen and the home were clean and neat. The place was quiet and peaceful. The cats are shy, but friendly. Vanessa was an excellent host. All around, I couldn't have asked for a better AirBNB experience.",1
"Nice place , greatly located. We saw Vanessa only once ; the apartment did not seem to be occupied , only by 3 cats who were totally fine.
The price seems high for the place..but perhaps these are Boston prices !

",1
"Vanessa is very welcoming and friendly and her cats are very quiet. I had a great time at her place. Her house is well situated in Jamaica Plain, close to the metro and restaurants and shops. The room is big and I specially appreciated the large desk ... and the star wars lego.",1
"My husband and I had a great experience with Vanessa. We walked and used public transit and we were welcomed by kind hugs when we made it to her front porch. forest hills station and green street stations are within walking distance and Jamaica Plain is an amazing place. It's the place to be in Boston. Cute shops and restaurants along Centre street and quick access to downtown, north end and anywhere else you would like to go. I highly recommend Vanessa's place but also Vanessa because she is a hard working activist and beautiful human. ",1
Everything was perfect! She is an amazing host and i would definitely try to get the same booking again. The location is a bit far but it really depends where you wanna go and the reason of your trip ,1
The place was perfect for me and my girlfriend. Vanessa was really nice and helped us with all our questions. Everything was clean and we had full access to the whole apartment. The neighbourhood was really nice and awesome to enjoy our breakfast at the back porch. Vanessa was rarely there so we saw more of her cats! ,1
"Caroline's place was great, just as the picture showed! The location and neighborhood was great. She was very easy to communicate with, and we felt very welcome at her home. Thanks again Caroline! ",1
Wonderful place and nice host. Everything is clean and Caroline provide us with accurate and detailed information. I would love to visit again!!  ,1
"Our stay in Boston was perfect, the apartment looked exactly like the pictures. The accommodations were very comfortable and clean. It felt like a second home.  The location was central, 10-15 minutes from Fanuell Hall and same for Fenway park. Caroline was very accommodating, responsive, and helpful. I highly recommend staying here.  ",1
"Everything about Caroline's home was perfect for a long weekend with friends.  Her home is situated in a great location from everything the city has to offer.  No need to pack extra - she has provided additional towels, etc and allows full access of her kitchen with all the essentials.  I would definitely stay again!",1
The place was beautiful and in a great location!,1
"Caroline's place was just as described and depicted in the pictures. She was very easy to communicate with and we enjoyed our stay. Even though we arrived super late on Friday, parking was not an issue. I wouldn't hesitate to book with Caroline again in the future!",1
"If you're headed to Boston, and ""Southie"" in particular, this is the perfect place to stay!  A beautiful condo with all the amenities.  Clean, quiet and spacious.  Caroline provides everything you need.  Will certainly recommend it to friends and family and I will rent it again when back in Boston.  Cheers!",1
Caroline's place was amazing! Honestly one of the best airbnb's I've stayed in. Everything was extremely clean and she had everything you could need from a home away from home. We enjoyed staying here and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Boston.,1
We thoroughly enjoyed our stayed at Caroline's! Checkin and out was very easy and we loved having parking available. The space was clean and had plenty of room for us. The location was great also as we were just a short uber ride from everything. I would highly recommend this place and can't wait to come back!,1
Great place to stay for the weekend! Very clean and easy arrival and checkout! Super cute and cozy! Fun little street for food and such near by as well as the beach! ,1
"Gregs Apartment is a lovely place, well arranged with all you may need during your stay. The south Boston neighborhood is quite and was perfectly located just 10 minutes to the airport and 10 minutes to business district. Restaurants and supermarkets are close by in walking distance. I'll book his apartment for sure when I'm coming back to Boston. ",1
Greg's apartment is really nice and he provided us with everything we needed for our stay. He was always available if I needed any extras or had any questions. The location is also close to many shops and restaurants. The bus stop is about 1-2 min walk away and the Broadway T is about 15 min walk. I wouldn't hesitate to book this apartment again!,1
"Greg was very accommodating to all of my request, even my last-minute requests. The condo looks just like how it shows in the pictures. It is clean with no weird smells, which I very much appreciated. Greg responded quickly during the stay, and was proactive about checking in and making sure we had everything we need. There is lots of space to store your stuff. My only issue: the water pressure was too low in the shower and it was a bit dark in the bathroom. Other than that, Greg as a host was super AWESOME.",1
"The place was very nice, renovated & ocupied with many things you need & more. We didnt meat Greg but comunication has been very good.
We chose south boston and this appartment because it is not far from the convention center. In practice is isnt that close & no bus realy helps.
On nice days it is ok but there has been snowy days too...
Its not far from downtown but the bus from the T station is rare...
Thanks Greg for everything.
Boston is a great city with welcoming people.

"Greg's place was great. Condo was clean, bed is super comfy and the bottle of wine was very welcomes after the long drive to Boston!  Parking a little tricky but we found a spot within a few minutes. Thanks! ",1
"We had a great stay in Boston at Greg's. The place was clean, convenient and comfortable. We enjoyed a couple of places in the neighborhood - some tasty snacks at Loco and a solid breakfast at Mu's. Thanks very much, we definitely recommend Greg's condo!",1
"Greg's place was wonderful. One full bed in the bedroom and one sofa bed in the living room. Plenty of space. He even came to drop off extra sheets! Big screen TV. Felt like a safe area to walk around at night. Real close to the Seaport convention center. If I had to visit Boston again, would consider Greg's place again!",1
It was great. Very nice and clean apartment. Close to lots of great stuff. Had a lot of great info for people new to Boston too. Definitely recommend. ,1
"Stayed at Greg's apartment for 7 nights and everything was as promised. Very clean and comfortable apartment, which had all the amenities that we needed. Greg was also prompt with any requests or questions that we had during our stay. Would definitely recommended Greg's apartment for anyone staying in the Boston area! ",1
"Greg's place was in a great location, the apartment was clean and functional.  Greg's girlfriend was very accommodating when we arrived early. She met us at the apartment and we were able to drop off our bags while the unit was cleaned.   Only a 5-10 uber ride to the World Trade Center! ",1
"Neighborhood is very cute and safe. The place was extremely clean and looked just like it does in the pictures. Greg was very attentive and easy to communicate with. I will definitely be coming back!
",1
Great place to stay in a great neighbourhood. Greg was an accommodating host.,1
"Greg was a great host, and the place was super nice and in a great location. Comfortable beds, nice kitchen. Only downside was extremely low hot water pressure in the shower.",1
"Gregory was great. He was informative, kind, and had everything prepared for us by the time of our arrival. He even set the central AC on for us so that it would be cool when we checked in. There was even complimentary wine left on our counter from him! Overall, my friends and I had a great stay. The place was well equipped, clean, and quiet.",1
"Everything was awesome. 
Soft bed.
Super walkable neighborhood.
Cozy apartment.
Loved it.",1
Very pleasant stay at Greg's. This is a true small Boston condo. It is perfect for 2 people and a bit of a stretch for 3. We had a party of 3 and Greg set this expectation upfront.  Everything in his description was dead on. Subway is 10 minutes away by walk and Uber or Lyft are everywhere.  Greg stopped in to make sure everything was perfect and was fully accessible if we needed him. Having access to a washer and dryer was fantastic as well. I would recommend this condo to anyone.,1
Great stay in South Boston.  Location was perfect for our needs.  Very easy check-in and out.  Greg responsive to needs.  Thanks!,1
The apartment is very nice and well located in South Boston. Close to services and public transportation. ,1
"It was our first experience with Airbnb and it was fantastic. Everything was as described and well placed. As a mature professional I came to Boston with my wife and 11 years old son for few meetings in Harvard University and also some sight seeing. It was the best place for me. Good and lively neighborhood with lots of good restaurants, 24 hours shops all in few minutes walk and 15 minutes walk to beach. Good access to public transport with 2 minutes walk to bus station and 15 minutes walk to Broadway tube station. The place is renovated and everything is fresh and new, no smell or dump. Very large kitchen that has everything you need for cooking. Nice and efficient air condition which is needed in summer.  Greg was very well responsive and already prepared everything for our arrival. Big screen TV and good internet",1
"Sean was very flexible with the check-in. The apartment was as advertised, simple, but adequate and clean. The location is great with shops and restaurants nearby and close to central Boston. The check-out was similarly painless.",1
"The apartment was exactly as advertised: small and nothing fancy, but immaculately clean, comfortable, and in a fantastic location. Sean was incredibly accommodating and fast to communicate, and made it effortless to get our key. He even gave us a place to leave our bags for the day after checking out before our late train left. The bed was comfortable, the air conditioner kept us comfortable despite 90+ degree heat outside, and we got the whole apartment to ourselves. 

I can't imagine a better place to stay if you want a private retreat while exploring Boston.",1
"The apartment is really close to the places to be. Fenway park with its bars and pubs is directly round the corner. The neighborhood is cool and you have there everything you need (the T, 7-11, Starbucks...)
Because of the close bars and the stadium it is from time to time quite loud. The other guys in the house aren't too disturbing. 
The apartment is short but it has everything you need but it could be cleaner.
I would come back anytime...",0
The listing was lovely and in a great location. It was smaller than the listing pictures showed but only the kitchen was at all cramped. Saturday morning it got extremely noisy for twenty minutes at 6 am due the windows overlooking the dumpster. We also had Wifi problems that were not fixed. Ultimately did not detract from our experience much and was a lovely weekend.,0
A really good location with view to the Red Sox Studium and a lot of bars and restaurants around the corner. The apartment itself is really quiet as it is faced to the back of the building. We had a good stay and can recommend this place definitely.,1
"The apartment was awesome. Just as described in the listing. Location could not have been better as I stayed there because I was attending a Red Sox game. Apartment was what you would expect from an older city apartment. Nothing luxurious but what a real city apartment looks like. Neighborhood was very safe to walk around at all hours and lots of restaurants and bars. There is no TV though in the apartment, but the wifi works great so you can stream from an ipad if need be. Sean was awesome very accommodating, and answered me quickly with any  emails or questions I had. I would definitely stay here again.",1
"Pretty much just a clean room with a bed.  Really, that's all I needed.  And it was affordable.  And Sean was great and helpful.  It really has NO amenities, which is true to the listing, but I left some shampoo there so it might still be there when you stay there.  :)",1
"If you are a Puritan this is the place for you. With absolute bare walls and an extra mattress leaning against one you will not be overwhelmed by the details. No shelves or night stands to put your stuff on. Even the wifi cables and router sit on the floor in a tangle of wires. 
The kitchen is like something out of an Eastern European flat. So cramped you can barely fit between the counter and the stove. You can only open the fridge door a quarter of the way. But it does have a gas stove. 
The bathroom has cracked plaster in the shower area and the shelf in the shower is mildewed with the laminate wood coming up. 
Our alarm clock in the morning consisted of the garbage truck at 5:45 am picking up the dumpsters outside our window (which was gone through every couple of hours through the night by street people). Then from 7:00 until just after 8:00 we got to hear the loud music of the neighbor while they got ready for the day. 
Sean is very quick to respond to questions and give information. And the location is great for getting around Boston. ",0
"Sean's appartement was as described, very well situated, sean was always available, the check in and out were very flexible.
The appartment  could be cleaner and less noisy from the street. It was impossible to stop the heat but he told us that he Will Fix it...",0
"The apartment was clean, the landlord gave us necessary equipment after first call.",1
Near the subway and Fenway park,1
"Sean's apartment is just as described and pictured.  Clean, quiet and conveniently located, and the small kitchen is equipped with everything needed.  We were able to find parking in front of the building during our stay.
Sean is very prompt in responding to my emails.  Will definite stay again.
",1
"The listing was accurate and the studio was clean. Sean was accessible via text when I had a little confusion about how to get into the building, and helped me resolve the issue immediately, which I really appreciated. Overall, my stay was easy and comfortable. My only bit of advice to future travelers would be potentially not to stay at this location on a Monday night since Tuesday morning was apparently a garbage pickup day, and since the apartment is right above the back alley of the building it was quite loud early in the morning. But hey, it's a city and that might just be par for the course in this neighborhood!",1
"Great location especially if you are going to attend a baseball game. The apartment itself is small, quiet and as the listing says there are no amenities (no tv). Sean was very clear and we had no issues during our stay. ",1
"We had a hugely busy schedule in town and this location was perfect. If I were vacationing and looking for a place to relax, I may have been disappointed. There is a full little galley kitchen which we didn't use and small table and chairs in the studio. Having a comfortable bed in a quiet building at an affordable price was exactly what I bargained for. 

Sean was readily available and responded to inquiries quickly. ",1
We had a pleasant experience. The description of the place was quite accurate as it was indeed suitable for 3 adults. The beds were also very comfortable. Our stay was made even more enjoyable since the host was very accommodating. We would stay here again on our next visit.,1
"The location is perfect! My wife and I wanted to stay within walking distance of our family in Back Bay, and we were able to do so here for a fraction of the price of a hotel. The apartment is small, but clean, and Sean is a very accommodating host. We were able to check-in and check-out as our schedule demanded without any issues. 

Regarding some of the other comments about noise, it is pretty noisy, especially Friday night. But it's pretty typical city noise. Sean can't control when the garbage gets picked up. 

Overall, we had a great experience and would be happy to stay here again next time we visit Boston! ",1
Place was great.... Amazing location. Great communication from host.,1
"Sean was great. Although there was an initial mix up with the keys, everything went smoothly from there and Sean made sure that everything was taken care of. A perfect place to stay in the Fenway area of Boston. I'll stay here again if I return to the city.",1
"While Sean was very courteous and responsive in setting up the reservation, once we arrived in Boston we had to take a train to meet him to pick up our keys which was fairly inconvenient as we had hoped to take a cab in the rainy weather directly to the apartment. I think as a host, if you make an error (like forgetting to leave keys in a lock box), you should meet the guests at the location. I was uncomfortable suggesting it, however. The apartment itself was in a great location (near a T station), clean, and spare and I appreciated the wifi. Like the other reviewers have said, there is really loud noise (garbage trucks? We had no idea what it was) directly outside the window starting late at night and into the morning. This is absolutely not an exaggeration. If you can sleep through that, then you may not be bothered. Location was convenient and it was a good price for an entire apartment but I wouldn't stay here again due to the few (large) inconveniences. ",0
"Sean was easy to communicate with, and flexible on check-in time, which was great.  His apartment was easy to find, and the neighborhood was great:  close to numerous restaurants, theaters, etc.",1
"Host had a friendly attitude.  The apartment description was accurate and the Fenway neighborhood had lots of fun things to do.  I appreciated that the kitchen had a full set up.
I plan on staying here again when I go to a Red Sox game.",1
"I had to write 3 messages before I got an answer but I finally got it.
Getting the keys via lockbox was easy but we missed a bit of real contact.
We found the sheets on the bed and had to do it ourself but the real bad surprise was having to clean the toilets before use.
We only stayed 2 days but we had the visit of a pest control society while we were out and met a bug in the bathroom...
The appartment is well located in a good neighborhood and ok for the price but we really regret not to have felt welcome as usual in our previous airbnb experiences...
",0
"Everything was fine. The location, as mentioned by others, is really convenient. I never actually saw Sean, but that really did not matter because there was nothing wrong in the apartment",1
"The apartment is in a nice location close to the center of the City and closeby Fenway stadium. It offers all the basics for a short stay in Boston. Although we did not meet Sean personally, he was easy to get in touch with.",1
"We had a great time staying at the studio apartment. It was very easy to communicate with Sean throughout our stay. We never met, but I felt like everything we needed was attended to.  The directions provided for finding the apartment and getting the key from the lock box were very clear. The location was fantastic, right across the street from a very nice park and around the corner from Fenway Stadium and House of Blues concert venue. Everything was exactly as described, I will definitely stay there again next time I go to a show in Boston!",1
"Sean was a great host - location was amazing (Fenway right out the window), nearby the subways and transit, lots of cool stuff within walking distance. Apartment had everything we needed, and Sean was very helpful and quick to respond before and even during the trip.",1
"The apartment is in the wonderful Fenway area, close to many restaurants and things to do.  The apartment itself is small, but adequate.  It was wonderful to have our own kitchen so we didn't need to eat out all the time!  There was occasional morning noise outside the window, but most mornings were quiet.  If you do plan to bring a car, the cheapest parking is $20/night at a nearby gas station.  ",1
This was overall an extremely pleasant experience. Sean was a great host and the place was very clean and the location was great! We would definitely stay here again. ,1
"We didn't meet the host in person but Sean left precise and easy-to-follow instructions for us. Nice apartment, good location, easily accessible via subway. Highly recommended!",1
"Corresponding with Sean was great as his replies were prompt and he readily answered our queries over email. 

The flat was located in an excellent location and my friends and I could even walk to downtown from there though the subway will definitely be quicker. But if you are looking to soak in the sights, walking is a good choice. The walk too us through Boylston street, which I guess is one of the shopping belts in Boston given the number of shops and restaurants there. 

I'd recommend the place for backpackers looking for a place to spend the night. We liked it that the bed linen was clean and heating was good. ",1
Great location. Sean was quick to respond to any issue we had.  I'll definitely be dropping by this apartment again when I'm in Boston in the future!,1
Dwelling was exactly as described and Sean was extremely helpful. Definetly recommend the Kenmore area and Sean as your host.,1
Great location for a great price. Sean was a helpful host and easy to contact. I found the previous reviews to be fairly accurate regarding noise and the quality of the apartment.,1
I had a great stay in Boston. The apartment is very conveniently located. Sean was also easy to reach and communicate with. It was a breeze. :) Thanks for letting me stay in your apartment! :) ,1
"Sean was a great host, he was very precise about the apartment and was located in a great location. It was a great apartment for the price in Boston!",1
"The neighborhood was really convenient, and a short walk to the MFA and Newbury street. Sean was really helpful, and everything was prepared just as described in the description. The mattresses were so comfortable. Everything was in good condition, and the lock box was easy to navigate. Only downside is that it could use some dusting.",1
"Place was fine, we enjoyed our stay. Sean was very responsive and helpful. Oh, and the internet is fast! :)",1
"Good experience, had great communication when questions arose. The good location made it easy to get around and see the city.",1
"Apartment was exactly as described. Great value, with the exception of a slightly leaky shower. Sean was very responsive to all of our inquiries. Good experience overall!",1
"My girlfriend and I found Sean to be a wonderful host. The apartment was clean and in a fantastic location. You can see Fenway out the back window, and there are several excellent restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance. Sean was very responsive, and our trip to Boston was comfortable.",1
Good place. ,1
Check-in was flexible and everything was as described. Great location!,1
"Amazing location, apartment was nice and clean. Internet super fast. Great communication with Sean. Bed is low down so anyone with a bad back beware! ",0
Great location and a functional space. Kitchen is small but fully equipped. Good value if you want to stay in the Back Bay Area. ,1
Great location. Nice bars and restaurants nearby. Apartment is basic but adequate for a place to crash and a home base for seeing the city.  ,1
"I only needed the apartment for the night as I was seeing a show at The House of Blues which is just around the way.  It was small and tidy and so close to good food and other attractions.

Sean is an excellent with communication.  He always replied to my inquiries promptly.",1
Check in was easy and flexible. The apartment is nice and clean. Sean was very responsive. Everything is within walking distance. ,1
"Overall we were really happy with our stay, it was our first time with  airbnb so we weren't sure what to expect but it was a great apartment, clean, convenient location, everything we needed for a couple of nights. The only thing was getting the keys, when my girlfriend went to get them from the lockbox there were keys for 2 different places there and if Sean hadn't happened to arrive at that moment we wouldn't have known which keys were ours. Otherwise great communication from Sean and a great stay!",0
"Good size place for what we needed, but was intrigued about how small the kitchen was. It worked for us and we are able to prepare some meals. Loved the internal heating after coming in from the chilly Boston wind. Sean was very prompt at returning messages and gave great detail. Flexibility on check in was still dependent on previous occupant.  Getting the key was reasonably easy and straight forward.  We found it to be a good Central location to what we wanted to see. Found an excellent online review about a restaurant a few blocks away called sweet cheeks and was so glad we checked this out- fantastic.",1
"Great location! 2 minute walk to Fenway Park. Place was as described, perfect for what you need. Bed, bathroom, kitchen & heating. Picking up the keys was easy from lockbox. 
Make sure you ask what keys to take as there could be more then you need.",1
"Great time! Sean was very helpful with information around the apartment. Great location for everything we did in Boston. 
Thanks Sean!",1
Sean is a really nice and kind host. Room was easy to access from near metro station (about 10 minutes). The room was clean and enough to accommodate 4 people. We have a great time there. He is helpful when something needed. Thanks!,1
"I will start by saying this was my first experience with air bnb and wasn't sure what to expect. i will say the location was great, it was walking distance to the game and we only needed the room for a quick sleep.

the negatives were, we arrived at 3pm with check in time being after 12pm we thought we would be fine. Sean was there cleaning the room when we arrived which was no big deal. what bothered me was it looked like someone had either urinated in the sheets or spilled something because there was a pile of the dirty sheets with a huge wet spot; that grossed me out.

the room was basic, and worked for a night. I think possibly we might just be old for such an experience. I am in my mid 30s and used to staying in decent hotels. if I was in my early 20s would have been totally fine with the place.

I guess I was trying to get a bargain and you basically get what you pay for. the room was clean enough, great location but i would opt to pay more for a nicer place.",0
  Good Location,1
"The apartment was clean as it could be considering the age of the building, location was nice, and access to the apartment was easy. Very close to Berklee. Overall I had a really good experience here :) Thanks for everything!",1
"The neighborhood was great, keep in mind that your paying for the location and how close it is to Fenway and public transport. The room was okay but great seeing as how short notice we booked it, less than a day before coming. I only stayed a night but it served my purpose of sleeping. One word of Caution is that in the summertime it will be hot but there is an A/C in the closet. ",1
"Apartment is in a very good lacation. A littlebit small for 4 person, but good pricce .
Very easy to find the lockbox where the key is. ",1
"The listing is accurate. This is a no frills kindof place. I was able to get in and out with no problems are described. Sean is within reach via email/text.

Need your own toiletries. ",1
"Great proximity to Fenway- we were less than a ten minute walk from door to the gate. Sean was communicative about getting into the unit, which he said would be ready by noon. When we got there at 12:30, there were wet towels on the chair and the bedsheets hadn't been changed. We wouldn't have noticed were it not for the fact that both the towels and comforter had been replaced when we stopped back in a few hours later.

We did have a decent night's sleep and appreciated the great location, which allowed us to have a great run along the Charles River in the morning!",0
"Place was in a great location, right next to Fenway Park, can't beat it. Nice studio apartment was perfect for our visit. Please beware there is no parking at the unit, which may not matter for most as the subway is a short walk down the corner, but there is a public garage about 4 blocks away which was easy to use and only $10 for overnight parking. The unit is mostly filled with young people but was very quite and easy to use.",1
"Sean was a great host.  Easy to get a hold of, he'll reply to messages promptly within the hour.  He's also very accommodating and flexible with changes in itinerary as long as it meets airbnb policies.

The location of the apt is very convenient, it's a 3-5 minute walk from the Kenmore Station on the D green line of the MBTA so you can easily get anywhere around Boston.  It's also within a 15 minute walking distance to the Prudential center and major eating establishments and of course Fenway Park is only 5 minutes away!  The area around the apartment is safe and clean.  The apartment itself is perfect for what I needed.  There are two Queen size mattresses there that will comfortably sleep 4 people.  The bathroom and kitchen are readily accessible.  There's also other essentials including AC and wifi internet.  The place suits my purpose well and I was really glad to have stayed there.

Thank you, Sean, for the great stay!",1
"Sean was very quick to return emails during our stay and was helpful finding a place for me to park.  The neighborhood was nice and clean.  The space was utilitarian, which is just what I wanted.",1
"This studio flat is in a great location and easy to get around. Boston is expensive, so it is a bargain for a landing pad close to downtown. However, being a studio, it's probably better for one or a couple. Bath is great with good hot water which was welcome, and kitchen facilities are tight but there if needed. Worth noting if it's important to you that the laundry room is in the basement of a neighboring building. Easy to find lock box and communication was generally straightforward. Fenway is noisy during games but that can be a plus or a minus, we enjoyed the rock concert next door! I doubt you can find a cheaper place in such a good location but it is best described as basic.",0
"The apartment was exactly as described. Sean let us check in early which was a great help. He provided easy to follow instructions on how to access the apartment. The location of the apartment is unbelievable. We were able to walk everywhere we needed to and it was only a short cab ride anywhere else. The apartment isn't big, as described, but we had four people and we were more than comfortable for a few nights. And for the price, it can't be beat. Thanks Sean, we had an amazing time in Boston! ",1
"Everything was exactly as described. very good location, quite close to the Kenmore subway station and to the Fenway.",1
"The apartment is in a great location, despite the fact it is not in the best of shape it gives good value for money.
I had some trouble getting in as previous guests did not leave the key on time. Sean was quick to reply even though he was out of town and eventually things worked out. If your looking for something private, central and not too expensive this is a good place to go.",1
"This listing is what it says on the tin: basic and clean with easy access to the Fenway area. The apartment does show its age but for a city as old as Boston that's to be expected. 

It was a bit difficult to get responses from Sean closer to our stay and during the key pickup process--we had instructions but did find we had to figure some of the process out on our own while awaiting a response.

Good for a basic stay but may be more of an advanced process to stay here if you're an AirBnB first-timer.",0
"Please read this review carefully.  I feel it is my responsibility to give the pros and cons very clearly....

PROS
-Very cheap place to stay
-This property is a FIVE minute WALK to Fenway
-The wifi is super fast
-The water is hot

CONS
-Everything else

Let me be clear:  This place met our needs for the ""guy weekend"", which was to spend as much time at Fenway as we possibly could.  We were very appreciative of the short walk to the park, and the fast Wifi.  But, the apartment was basically a room with two mattresses on the floor, a tiny bathroom and a very, very tiny kitchen.  The air conditioner was underpowered, we could hear the footsteps of the people above us, and the garbage truck emptied the three dumpsters outside our window at 5:55 am on Saturday morning. 

In addition, the host could have spent a hundred dollars on some functioning pillows, maybe a wash cloth or two, and some blankets for the second bed....

Sean was a little hard to reach with instructions, but I don't fault him too much for it as he did say he had been travelling. 

Short version:  If you have a serious limit to your budget and want to spend your money and time on other things -- particularly Fenway -- and you don't care for much more than a mattress with some air conditioning and fast wifi, then this is your spot.   

If, however, you want anything coming close to creature comforts, then you should move on and find something else. 

I wish I was able to be more charitable, but unfortunately this is the reality of this property. ",0
"Good experience.  Parking was a bit tricky; otherwise, no problems.",1
"We did not get to meet Sean but this place was perfect for us. My husband, 2 kids, and myself stayed here and it looks exactly as it does in the pictures. We went to Boston because my husband is a huge Red Sox fan and of course, we wanted to see the city. This place is about a 5 minute walk (or less) to Fenway. There is a lot in walking distance of the apartment. So we never had to go far. The apartment was clean and check in was smooth. I would definitely recommend this place! Thanks again, Sean! ",1
"We were rather disappointed with this accommodatiion. The host did not even meet us, but left rather complicated instructions to access the keys to the apartment.  We did not meet the host at all during our stay, or even hear from him as to how we were getting on.  The apartment was somewhat shabby, and not really like the image indicated, as this only showed a small corner of one room.  The kitchen was tiny, and although quite well equipped, it badly needed redecoration and a good clean. In addition, the apartment backed onto a yard with three dumpsters, and on 4 occasions we were awakened early in the morning by the noise of the dumpsters being emptied.",0
I fell in love with the view of this apartment. Fenway out the window as promised. My expectations were pretty low going in because I realized it was very basic budget accommodations. Sean was helpful with the different questions I had about the city. The instructions for obtaining lockbox key were very clear. The location is great and the building old and had a lot of character. I came to town with a friend of mine for the night to catch the Red Sox game. We understood it to have a large enough bed to accommodate us since it says 1 to 4 people. When we arrived the bed seemed quite small. When I asked Sean about it he told me that there was 2 mattresses on top of each other and to take them apart and he thought that there were sheets in the closet for both  ( there were not) we had explored Boston all day and didn't return til 1 am..pulling a mattress apart was not what I wanted to do. We were so tired and since there was only 1 sheet we decided to just be very cozy. The bed was comfortable and we slept well until around 5 am when people were down in the alley going through glass bottles in the trash dumpsters which was very loud. (Not sure if that happens all the time) The kitchen is small but would be helpful if you needed one. I would not recommend having 4 people stay as it would be quite cramped ( but if you are looking for a budget place with a great view..this would work.  ),0
"Sean met us when we arrived. He provided helpful information about the area/parking. 

I defer to Ian's June 2015 review. He nailed many of the issues I had with the rental. The apt is extremely small. It's an old, run down building. Stacked up mattresses. The place was very warm and stuffy. The a/c is underpowered. Peeling paint on ceiling. Oldish bed linens and towels. No wash cloths. Had to search for toilet paper. The place smelled. Floor was sticky. Stove had grime on burner. The sense of customer service was non-existent. 

My husband and I arrived, stayed for a few minutes and explored Bodton. Returned around 10 pm. The place was hot and smelly. We left. Dropped the keys at the lock box inconvenient and across the highway. Homeless guy sleeping nearby. Dark area. 

I requested a partial refund. Sean replied no and said the issues I brought up were not accurate. They are accurate. I do not have very high expectations but it was beyond the pale. Like visiting a frat room cleaned of clutter.",0
"Sean's place was decent considering the low price. We were stopping over in Boston for a night before heading out early next morning so we just needed a place to stay for the night, for that purpose the place worked out well. But it is very small and pretty run down so I would not recommend it for a longer stay unless you literally just are looking for a place to crash. ",0
"disgusting, disappointed, dirty. The two matress were disgusting and uncomfortable. The bathroom I can't explain it. In the fridge was some old food. Before we arrive we inform Sean that we would like to use the two beds. When we arrive, we dont find sheets for the seconf bed and we ask Sean what can we do, and he say we can go to find him somewhere and he can give us all what we need. This is service? The idea of Airbnb is ""feel like at home"", but here I can only say ""better go to the hostel/hotel"". I can't recommend it. If you read the comments from other peolple you find that a lot of them say the same like me. ",0
"The experience at this room was great, everything worked out as planned.  Easy check in process and Sean was communicative throughout.  The room was exactly as described, nothing fancy, just a small studio but that is all we needed.  Me and my wife were staying here specifically because of the location close to fenway, it is a 3 minutes walk out the door to the stadium, awesome location.  I would recommend.",1
"If you are looking for a very basic accommodation, you are at the right place. We stayed here with four and to be honest this was too much for this appartment.",0
"The apartment was easy to find and enter.  We did not meet the host, though he gave very specific directions as to where we could pick up the key, as well as parking suggestions, and lots of ways to reach him in case we needed anything.  The apartment was definitely no frills, I think it is just used as a rental, but it was clean and everything we needed.  Very close to Fenway.",1
"Location, location, location.  I can't  express it any stronger.  The apartment is perfect.  Was there to see the Foo Fighters at Fenway and while everyone around was paying 40 to 50 to park, or even 400 a night for a hotel, we were able to take a leisurely stroll around the block and BAM! Back to our home away from home for the weekend.  Also wicked close to Kenmore station for taking the T. Sean was super helpful with check in instructions.  Hope to make it back again soon!",1
"Sean was a great host - always there to answer our messages via airbnb and he came out to us within 15 minutes when we had issues with the front door key! Great service. The key was a bit stiff in the lock, that's all - made us look stupid when Sean arrived to open the door immediately. The apartment had everything we needed - good shower, comfortable bed and provisions in the kitchen. Probably value for money considering its Boston. ",1
Easy to communicate with and a great location...right across from Fenway Park!!! Comfortable room and convenient location. Thank you for your hospitality. ,1
"Listing accurate, enjoyed staying at the apartment for the short time we were there.  Was extremely convenient to the T and to Fenway - which is why we went.  The hot water can be a little temperamental, but nothing bad.  We enjoyed it much more than staying in a hotel.  ",1
Very easy to work with. Responsive and thorough. ,1
great location,1
"Very convenient apartment - right in the neighborhood where we needed to be. Would be perfect for someone attending a game or concert at Fenway. Thanks, Sean!",1
Great location and easy parking! Apartment is a little small but if you are going to fenway it's perfect. Ideal for baseball games or concerts in fenway- we saw Zac Brown and loved the location.,1
"The host was very nice, very easy to communicate with. The apartment was clean and exactly as pictured. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've ever slept on. Nice, safe neighborhood. However, very noisy. It's an old building and I could hear every step taken by the person in the apartment above me. The apartment faces the alley behind the building and the noise started at 5:30am both days of my stay and didn't let up. The A/C wasn't very strong. I was there in mid-Aug and was only comfortable when I was sitting directly in front of it. I feel this apt is over-priced, but would be worth $100 a night if the Sox were having a home stand as it is literally around the corner from Fenway.",0
"The location is excellent! Close to lots of great restaurants, shopping, grocery store, local transit and steps away from Fenway Park.  The apartment is tiny, suitable for two people.  It has air conditioning, wifi and meets very basic needs.  It faces a back alley which can be noisy at times and interrupt sleep.  If you're looking for luxury I do not recommend.  Overall it suits its purpose.  Sean was great to deal with.  The way he has it set up, it pretty well runs itself.",0
"Just as pictured and described, very convenient for a visit to Fenway.
Thanks Sean!",1
This apartment was great for our one night stay in Boston.  It was clean and just as the listing said.  The check in/out process was great and we would definitely recommend this booking.,1
"We had a wonderful time! The location is great! Sean's instructions and perfectly clear and communicating with him was easy. Getting the door unlocked was a little tricky but once we figured it out, it was easy as can be. This was our first trip to Boston and after exploring much of the city, we still decided this would be a place we would stay again. Extremely close to Fenway and the Boston Back Bay Area, everything was in walking distance or just a subway ride away. ",1
"Sean, thanks for being such an awesome host for my boyfriend and I! The apartment was perfect for our needs. We went to the game at Fenway and it was a very short walk to the festivities! Bleacher bar before the game was a great spot! Great first time experience in Boston! We will be returning :)",1
Sean was a good host and provided clear instructions on accessing his apartment.  The place was clean and comfortable.  The bed was super soft and cozy!  This place is very convenient for getting around the city and is next to Fenway Park.  Thank you Sean for having us.  I would stay here again if traveling through Boston.,1
"Sean was friendly and always answered quickly. The apartment was as advertised. We found free parking on the North side of the bridge, which is a 10 minute walk away, not too far if you've previously unloaded all the bags.",1
Location is fine and technically the unit contains all you need . But the apartment requires refurbishment all over.,0
"My husband and I stayed at Sean's place in order to see a show at the House of Blues.  It was a perfect place for us to crash and we could see the HOB from the bay window of his studio appartment!  Sean was an incredibly easy to reach and communicate with host.  The instructions to find the key lockbox ere clear and presice.  We had absolutely no trouble getting into the apartment.  We commincated through the airbnb site and it was flawless.  I did have his cell number just in case but never needed it.  
Appartment was cozy and had everything we needed, just like the listing indicates.  Don't go in expecting luxuryl; we didn't and were very comfortable staying here for one night.  It's true what other reviewers said about city noises at night and in the early morning.  We were prepared for this and it was understandle and fine.  I'd like to contradict what other said about the room never cooling down.  When we were here, it was a hot day and night (80s in day, high 60s at night).  The a/c window unit was great if kept at the low setting.  We tried to crank it to high but when we came home after the show the apartment was stuffy.  So I put it back to low and it actually worked better and cooled the whole room nicely.  I slept great!  And the a/c unit helps drown out any noise outside the window, which for us was just a few.  I would definitley stay here again with just my husband.  If I needed a place to stay with my whole family (we have 2 kids) think we could all fit fine but I might chose somewhere a little bigger.  Perfect though for a place to crash for a night on the town!",1
"Sean was quick to contact and respond. His place was just as described, and just what my friends and I needed at the end of a long day: with a quiet, dark, cool room with soft beds, a small bathroom, and a kitchen. Picking up and leaving the keys were especially easy. ",1
"This is a tough place to review.

On the plus side -Cost and location: The price is amazingly cheap. Boston's hotel market is insanely expensive. Any hotels in the area are likely almost double the cost. Also, the place is in a great neighborhood. We went to a Red Sox game and Fenway is just a few blocks away. There are tons of great restaurants and museums and other things to do within walking distance.

Communication with Sean was good. When we first arrived there was an issue with the key that was neither our fault or his, and he worked really hard to remedy the problem.

The negatives: We stayed four nights and I was just getting over a cold (not a great way to start a vacation) and this place is really just not that comfortable. It is basically a college student's studio apartment - no TV, no couch, no decor, beat up old towels and pillows, small bathroom and tight kitchen. Wifi worked great. For a night or two this would have been no problem, but by the fourth night it was a bummer to have to come back to after dinner. If I was feeling better and we were enjoying Boston's night life more, this would not have been an issue.

So, this place is perfect if you want a cheap place in a great neighborhood. If you just need a roof, a bed and a toilet, then there are no problems. However, If you want a comfortable, cozy apartment to relax in after a long day, then this might not be a perfect fit.  ",0
"Great location, very affordable. Sean was very responsive and helpful!",1
"Accommodation was adequate although a bit of a squeeze for three guests with fairly large suitcases. Location was great. Host was quick to respond to questions and was helpful. 

The cons I would say is that the apartment needs to have a makeover. 

If you are not fussy and staying for a couple of days, it will be an ok place to stay at. 

If you are a light sleeper, you will be awaken by the garbage collectors early in the morning. ",0
"I happened to be near the flat when I met Sean. He seems a very nice man. He explain to me how to use the way to get the keys, which is very easy in any case. The flat is a bit old, but really cozy, and the bed is confortable. I stayed there just for one night, but I would recommend to you to rent this room because is very close to Boston downtown and you can go easily to everywhere, even in Allston or Cambridge (MIT, Harvard, Central...). If you go outbounds, down Boylston street, to the Red Socks stadium, you'll find many place to buy food and drinks. If you want to have breakfast, I would recommend that you go to Fenway Café (Brooklyne 61) where the brevages are cheaper than other places around that blocks. 

I definitely recommend you to rent Sean's flat, specially if you are looking for intimacy with your partner or simply not share the room with anyone else. A very good option for a greatest price.",1
"This is a great place to for a quick stop over in Boston. The location is perfect being in the Fenway neighborhood. Lots of bars, restaurants, and public transportation stops close by. Sean was good with given instructions for checking in. The reviews here seems to be fairly accurate. Garbage truck wakes you up in the morning, the place is small with no TV, and if you don't follow instructions well you'll have some trouble with the check in process. If your expecting the Ritz, you'll be disappointed. If you are looking for a quick place to take a shower and bed to sleep in... Then this place is great. Sean makes himself available for any question you may have. I would definitely stay here again. ",1
"We check in on 10 Nov and Out on 12 Nov.
On arrival we communicated via mobile to locate the keys. However, we were given the wrong number of the apartment after going up the 4th floor. After calling Sean, he then realized the apartment is on the ground floor. The location is great but the apartment is old and need a spring cleaning, The King/Queen mattress is also due to be replaced.

Sean's Fenway apartment was great. The location couldn't be better and it had everything I needed for a short stay. Sean was very good with communicating when I arrived and while I was there. The place was cozy and the bed was very comfortable!,1
"The apartment was great, perfectly located for games at Fenway or concerts at House of Blues. Street parking was a little tricky, but we parked at the shell station down the street for only $30 overnight. 

Thanks Sean! ",1
Location was ideal for walking to my event.,1
"The location of the apartment is very convenient!! The neighborhood is full of various cosy bars and cafes! 
Feels very safe and is walkable to all the main attractions. 
However for four people the flat is too small, and in the morning there are carbage collectors that are very loud.",0
"Great price, great location. Small, but we didn't need much space when it was just a place to lay our heads at night. Sean was very responsive and easy to contact with any issues. ",1
Sean's place was great. It was quite conveniently located and nice and cozy. It was just right for our quick visit to Boston.,1
"if you're going for a weekend, especially if you are going to see the sox play, this is a fantastically convenient & affordable place to stay.

pros: 
1. what you see is what you get. other than minor details, i knew exactly what this space would look like. it's not the lap of luxury, but that isn't what i paid for nor what i expected.
2. cost. i couldn't find a hotel room, in a comparable location, for less than $180/night
3. location. fenway is literally the next street over. many bars, restaurants, & other sights/attractions within walking distance, or using the easy access to mass transit. uber is an easy pickup in front. there is also a target, cvs, & grocery store within walking distance. 
4. access. easy instructions to get the keys & i was thankful it was on the 1st floor
5. communication. Sean was easy to contact, communicate with, & quickly responsive

cons:
1. noise. because of all of the bars nearby, there was a lot of late night / early morning foot traffic that was loud & obnoxious drunks. early morning trash pickup is very loud. unlike others, i didn't hear any neighbors, so that was nice.
2. wood slats under mattress move easily, resulting in spots that droop & are uncomfortable. we had to reset the slats a few times over the 9 days we were there. other than that, unlike what others have written, the mattresses were better than i expected.
3. towel racks would be nice, & more than one roll of toilet paper would've been appreciated.
4. the heat was overbearing. we actually had to keep the windows open, in the heart of winter, to combat the stifling heat.

overall, i would jump at the chance to stay here again. the 4 cons were minor inconveniences compared to everything this place has to offer. having stayed as long as we did, the angry reviews seem strange/petty & i question whether those folks actually looked at the description before they went.",1
Great host and great place! The sheets needed to be changed but Sean came after I checked in to change the sheets and provide clean towels. Thanks for the hospitality :),1
"Sean was quite helpful pointing out nearby (though scant) parking in advance, and the keybox instructions were very accurate. Unfortunately, we checked in via keybox before Sean had a chance to change sheets and tidy up so we encountered a small mess from the previous guests.",0
Sean's place got the job done for just spending the night for like 12 hours. Rigt next to Fenway/House of Blues and a bunch of fun stuff. It's no frills and inexpensive comparing it to what's around. Directions and communication to get in were clear and easy.,1
Easy to get keys from lockbox. Good communication,1
"I stayed here for one night and it was perfect. Great for one or two people but more than that could be a problem. It is located in the middle of the city which makes it easy to go anywhere. Although I didn't get to see Sean, he explained where the keys were and everything else perfectly. Would definitely stay here again :)",1
"Sean was very communicative, and checking in was easy and the place was very warm and toasty! Walking distance to all the things I needed--even a Trader Joe's! Like some other reviews said, it's an old building and somewhat spartanly furnished, but the bed was comfy and the experience was uneventful and safe. I would definitely recommend it and stay again if I am ever in Boston.",1
"It was a nice stay, very much near to downtown, which is plus point.",1
Convenient location to Fenway. ,1
The location was awesome  - just a stone's throw to Fenway and the House of Blues.  The building was extremely quiet and the apartment was basic but clean and comfortable.  Sean was a good communicator and provided good directions on how to find the place and get access to the building.  The only hiccup was difficulty getting into the lock box (to return the key) - which may have been due to the cold.  I would stay here again.,1
It's a very convenient place to live. ,1
I had a great stay at Sean's place.  He was very helpful and hospitable during my visit.,1
"The apartment was easy to get to, a great little walk to Symphony for the evening. For a small place it was exactly what was needed!",1
"Good experience, no main complaints except had a few key issues.",1
"Great place if you're just looking for somewhere to sleep when not exploring the city. The location is great, within walking distance of Fenway and Newbury. The apartment basically just has a bed and a table, so don't plan on spending too much time inside!",0
"Sean was great, the instructions for arrival and departure were clear and concise. The apartment was perfect for me and 3 mates to bed down while visiting Boston for a long weekend. Great location, perfect accommodations. 

Thanks Sean!",1
"Sean was very helpful and accommodating! He gave us a couple of tips of what to do during our stay and could be reached very easily. Apartment was as advertised, clean and cozy. ",1
"The apartment was disappointing compared to the pictures, it was dark and old the kitchen is extremely small and the bathtub was clogged which was disguting. This came with a rude and arrogant Host which all made my worst airbnb experience.",0
"This was a lovely experience overall. The apartment was located right near fenway, and it was clean and the kitchen was stocked with pots, pans, plates, glasses, silverware, and other helpful things. ",1
"I was in the department 4. The apartment was dirty, shabby walls, the bed was very uncomfortable, the shower was extremely ugly and kitchen girl. I did not like the place, it was not comfortable the stay if you wanted to be in the department. The walls in our case were dark and poorly painted. The bed was very old and uncomfortable, definitely not sleep well. The neighborhood was cute and was well described.

Estuve en el departamento 4. El departamento estaba sucio, paredes en mal estado, la cama era muy incomoda, la ducha era fea y la cocina extremadamente chica. No me gusto el lugar, no fue comoda la estadia si querias estar en el departamento. Las paredes en nuestro caso estaban de oscuro y mal pintadas. La cama era muy vieja e incomoda, definitivamente no dormiamos bien. El barrio era lindo y estuvo bien descripto.",0
"Great location next to Fenway, easy walk into the centre of the city. Even after the apartment was 'cleaned' I had to scrub the tub and the windows and shower curtains were incredibly dirty.",0
"Overall, we are not satisfied with this accommodation. We’d expect a lot more for the money we spent and would NOT recommend it!

PRO:
+ Good communication, friendly and fast responses 
+ Keys were easy to find. Sean found a flexible solution so you don’t have to wait for the host to hand you the keys so you can arrive whenever you like.
+ Location of the apartment was okay for us, we reached everything we wanted in little distance by bike or public transportation
+ Linings and towels were fresh and clean
+ WiFi was good

CONTRA:
- LACK OF HYGIENE (insect killer in the kitchen and mouse traps in every room give you an idea)
everything we took out of the cabinets was greasy and DIRTY you don’t wanna cook there, the kitchen trash had not been taken out and smelled DISGUSTING, crumbs in the Toaster oven, old URINE stains on the toilet, bathtub has not been cleaned either
- Also, you should be really close with your co-travellers, since you won’t be able to close the bathroom door all the way. There’s a screw missing (that could be fixed easily) and keeps the door hanging loose and scratching over the floor
- Bathtub drain was clogged 
- You can clearly hear (and smell) the neighbors through the walls. I guess there a lot of young students living in this building. Don’t stay there if you like it quiet and private.
- All in all the apartment is anything but nice and cozy. The walls could really need some fresh paint and the floors a good scrub",0
"Seans place was in a good location for a weekend trip to a(EMAIL HIDDEN)munication with sean was easy and he replied to my messages pretty quickly. The place is a bit worn down due to the peeling paint and bathroom door not closing properly, however it was a pleasant stay. ",1
"The place is ok, a little shabby looking compared to the photos which is a pity because the location is good and it was clean. A tiny bit of work would turn this from an ok into a very good place to stay.",0
"Everything ran very smoothly. Sean was very attentive to every doubts we had (not many, actually). Location was fantastic.",1
"Thank You Sean, clean , comfortable, and convenient . It was exactly as you described . I hope to stay again soon .,  ",1
"Not sure what to say about this experience.  Cheap place, centrally located, but likely very unsanctioned, since you have to get the key from a lock box on a fence two doors down.  Old building, run down, paint peeling, water leaks everywhere in the bathroom when you shower.  No hair dryer (although Sean offered to bring one).  The view looks out on to a wall of graffiti and is located over the dumpster (which is an issue if you open the window and don't enjoy the smell of garbage). I've been lucky so far, but this was probably the worst air B & B place I have experienced.  ",0
Stayed one night - great location to go to Fenway Park.  Sean was quick to respond to questions and accommodated an early check in for us. Small space but ok for us for a place to spend one night.,1
"I did not meet Sean in person but his communications were excellent.
The key box worked well and access to the property was easy.
I stayed in the apartment for the Boston marathon so the location was great but would also be perfect for Fenway Park or anything in the city centre.
On booking the apartment I was aware it was an older property and not in the luxury category however I was disappointed in the standard of cleaning and maintainance with a number of things not working properly.Indeed I left the apartment significantly cleaner than I found it.  With a small investment of time and money this property could be upgraded and be fantastic.",1
We definitely felt welcomed by this host. We appreciated the cleanliness of the apartment and his hospitality. ,1
"For the most part Sean responded promptly to emails.   The three strong points of the  apartment were its location, the fact that it was warm and the shower water pressure was very good.   The comforter was light and warm.  ",1
Apartment was a bit old and run down but for the price and location it's perfect. Great for anyone looking to watch a game at Fenway park. Close to shops and restaurant to walk. ,1
The place is in a very good location and Sean is very prompt in getting back to you.,1
"This apartment was close to public transport and also easy to get around places on foot. 
It was a very basic place with limited facilities. 
When I arrived at check in time the apartment was not cleaned and it appeared that the bed was remade for me with the same bedcovers and pillow cases.
The shower had excellent pressure but there was a lot of leaking water in the bathroom.
This place could be a great stop for 1 or 2 nights with some basic maintenance and improvement work and some more care to cleanliness and the guest experience.",0
"You're paying for the location, which is great. Getting access into the building and the apartment is rather a pain. Host does not provide instruction to access the place until you contact him. Host did not reply to airbnb messages. The place was extremely dusty and not clean. ",0
"We only stayed at Sean's apartment for 1 night. The apartment is small but it was just what we needed,. We were there for two days and one night and most of the time we were out and about sightseeing. We just basically slept and shower and the apt, therefore we didn't mind it being small. The location was convenient and close the Fenway park (we definitely recommend the Fenway stadium tour) and close to the metro/train.

The apartment has a full kitchen but we didn't use it. The bed was okay, big enough for two people. And the room has an a/c unit. The apartment and bathroom were clean. However, we did see some silverfish bugs crawling in the room. But besides that the apartment was well kept just like in the pictures.

We had a bit of an issue with the keys at the beginning but after that everything went smooth.",1
"Sean was very responsive to our messages and made us feel very welcome. He provided bottles of water for us in the fridge which were crucial since it was very warm the weekend we were there and weren't too familiar with the area yet.

If you're going to Fenway Park, the location doesn't get much better than this. It's probably a 5-10 minute walk.",1
"Awesome apartment! Sean answered quickly and made everything very easy. Cute little stay, and very close to everything you might want or need in Boston. Thanks!!",1
"It was a good location and ok for a one night stay, I personally wouldn't stay longer. The top mattress was a double and the queen was underneath, so we remade the bed on the bottom mattress as the top mattress was old and saggy. There was quite a bit of dust around the place, behind the heater etc..but for a one night stay it was ok. Great location to go to Fenway :) ",1
"I have used airbnb enough to come to expect a certain level of cleanliness of the house and timeliness of the host.  This host was disappointing on both counts.  It was very difficult to communicate with the host.  It wasn't until I texted, emailed and called that I got directions for entry.  Upon our arrival, I had to locate the key away from the building in a lock box attached to a random chain link fence.  That was my first red flag.  Upon entry, the house was filthy.  Literal piles of dust and dirt in the corners, which may not be so bad under normal circumstances, but both beds were mattresses on the floor, so we we were up close and personal with the dirt.  There were not enough linens, or towels. There was only a fitted sheet and a duvet that was much too hot!  No top sheet or blankets.  No hand towels or wash cloths.  The shower had a pile of partially used soap.  No coffee maker or blender.  All of this was the second red flag.  The clincher was when I came home and found a letter from the landlord explaining that airbnb was not legal in the building.  By then, I was very uncomfortable.  When I asked the host about the letter, he dismissed it saying he gets letters like that all the time.  The location was great, and I did expect small and old (which is was), but dirty, illegal, and understocked - not good!",0
Very clean and great location to catch a game at Fenway.  Sean make everything very easy and was available although we did not need him.  ,1
This apartment was in such a good location. Just a few minute walk to the Kenmore station on the green line. Also a short walk to the Back Bay Area. Couldn't have asked for a better location. Sean was also very easy to communicate with and provided very clear instructions. ,1
good location and room,1
Everything was as described,1
"We were disappointed with this listing. I am from Boston and so am very familiar with the city, and my wife and I have stayed in AirBnBs across the world, so hopefully our comments will be helpful to other travelers. 

We were most surprised at the lack of basic cleanliness of the studio apartment. Easily removable dust was along the walls, floors, under the bed, etc, and partially used soaps were scattered in the bathroom; meanwhile the presence of a mousetrap behind the bathtub made us fear the worst (luckily, we had no rodent surprises!). The one lamp in the bedroom did not work. We initially thought a cleaning had not been done prior to arrival, but the host assured us it had. The bathroom door does not close, even when pushed/held, severely limiting privacy. We didn't use the kitchen, which was just as well since the fridge can only barely open given the cramped space. The toilet did not work consistently.

I was also surprised when I got a call a few hours later from another of the host's guests staying at a different property asking to switch keys. Not only had the host shared my contact information with this person without my permission, he also expected us to resolve the issue between ourselves, which took time away from my plans in Boston. Meanwhile, I'm still confused as to why one key is able to open 2 different buildings; the host offered no explanation. This seems like an important security issue.

Finally, I was surprised when I received the welcome note from the host stating that I should not mention to anyone that we were using AirBnB at this property (as he put it, ""loose lips sink ships.""). We were disappointed by this secrecy and would prefer staying in places that are legally sanctioned for AirBnB use.

On the upside, we did appreciate that the host was flexible in our departure time, and for sure the location of the property, in the heart of Fenway, was very desirable. 

In re-reviewing the comments from other guests of this host, it seems clear that this host operates AirBnB at several properties (Fenway, Beacon Hill, other?) across the city, so future potential guests should note that all listed comments likely do not apply to all properties. This review is for one of the properties in the Fenway area.",0
Sean was very accommodating! We accidentally lost the keys and he was more then willing to assist us in getting new ones! (Again very sorry!) the apartment is in an ideal location and was perfect for the Fourth of July! Thanks for having us! ,1
"Sean's appartment is really nice, and anything worth explaining was clearly explained in his arrival information. Thank you!",1
"Sean was very helpful in communicating directions to us.  The apartment was in a very handy, safe location - close to Fenway, to restaurants, grocery store, Target, and the T.  We didn't use the kitchen, but it would have been helpful had our stay been longer. We appreciated the AC as well. Really a great deal. ",1
"We stayed here for 4 nights.  2 adults, 2 small kids.  The place was a bit older, but quite comfy and conveniently located to Fenway , the T, and many touristy spots.  Sean was a great host and communication was speedy.  I met him on check in and we chatted a little about the city and biking.  We had a little trouble with the front door key and Sean was quick to replace it.  We were close enough to Fenway to get a free fireworks show after a concert.  Great visit overall.  thanks sean!",1
"I had an excellent stay at Sean's place. I flew in to Boston from California because my San Francisco Giants were playing the Red Sox. What a perfect location! Fenway Park is virtually a few blocks away. There's a nice garden/park/trail across the street for a nice stroll. The Kenmore station is also nearby, which takes you anywhere in Boston. Sean's instructions were clear and finding the keys was easy. It was like a fun scavenger hunt to begin my adventure. The room is spacious for one person, but might be cramped for two. If there was such a thing as 1.5 person, it would be perfect. Basic stuff in the bathroom. I dig the bathtub. Kitchen is super small, but I really didn't spend that much time in there. I definitely recommend Sean's place for two people max. ",1
"The location is absolutely perfect if you're planning to commute. Parking is difficult in the area, but Boston is notorious for their parking laws and restrictions. There are trains available very close by. 
There are plenty of garages around the area that provide overnight parking. 
The neighborhood is nice and quiet. If you're looking to catch a Red Sox game, there is almost no better place to stay than Sean's. There are also a ton of great places to eat right around there. All in all, Sean's place was cozy with access to food and fun. ",1
Sean was very helpful! He came over and made sure we had everything we needed when we arrived. ,1
"Overall the place is a great value. You're right across from a big, lovely park with community garden plots. I legitimately saw baby bunny while running.

It does have everything that you need. The check in process seems daunting at first but overall it isn't bad. 

Sean is very accessible and friendly. I was there for business so it was good to have a quiet space.",1
Nice neighbourhood. Great location. Very close to Fenway park. Unfortunately retrieving the key from a lock box locked to a fence over a highway was not a great first impression. Secondly the key to the apartment blocks did not work and we were stranded outside at night. I tried to contact Sean but there was no answer. We ended up ringing another apartment to let us in. It meant we could not leave the apartment to go explore boston because we wouldn't be able to get back in. If the key worked it would have been an ideal apartment to stay in. However knowing you can leave your apartment and get back in is kind of important. ,0
"Sean was easy to communicate with. Great location near Fenway Park. Lots of food places, close to trains and in a great place. Apartment was a bit small but we were able to manage. Highly recommended!",1
"What a GREAT Guy!!!

One of the best persons you would meet. Kind, generous, and extremely polite! Certainly it is wise to stay at his place, and will be a capital fault not to rent from him. Will be glad to come back anytime, but knowing his generous personality, I doubt that his place will stay empty once the word gets around.

Hence, lets keep his praise to the minimum!
",1
"Firlian is vey cool, kind, and easy going. His house is very clean as it is, and he has a great heart for his visitors. I would be willing to go visit and stay again at his place. ",1
"Firlian is a great guy! His place is clean and it has just been renovated. He's easygoing and an extraordinary host: already on the first night he invited me to join him at a get-together with his friends, and the next day he took us (me and his other guest) to the cinema! I felt very welcome and would stay with him any time again!",1
"The house is in the quit place, witch is very great for living, the room is simple butt this is very big and comfortable. Also there is a lovely and friendly cat and Firlian is a very nice and very kind person. If I come to Boston second time I would like to choose this house again.",1
"I had a great stay over 2 nights. Firlian is a great host and had good recommendations for the area around. The room was quit big, the bed very comfy. Free parking in front of the door. Thanks for the perfect time in Boston!!!",1
Very hospitable host! The flat was very clean and comfortable. I def would give my recommendation!,1
Firlian was so welcoming and made sure everything went smoothly during my stay. ,1
"Firlian has been excelent with the communication prior my arrival and during my halt. I had a really comfortable stay at his place. Everything was provided in the way it's shown in the ad.
I would highly recommend it to anyone willing to stay in this area of the city.",1
Had a wonderful time in Boston and the house was perfect. Had a really good time with Firlian. Would suggest him to everyone ! Anytime again. Many thanks ,1
Courtney! Your place was beautiful and my cast was very pleased with their stay.  Thank you again for accommodating my special request.  The filming went swimmingly!,1
Courtney was an excellent host. Her home was very lovely and she left a nice note on the counter for us. Thank you for your hospitality! ,1
My business colleague and I stayed at Courtney's apartment for a conference taking place at the convention center. It was an easy $5-7 uber trip each way. The apartment was cozy and clean. Courtney had towels and toiletries waiting. My colleague and I were first timers so weren't sure what check out protocol was - like a hotel where you wouldn't strip the sheets or like staying at a relative's and yes we should strip the sheets. So a little guidance there would have helped so we didn't make an Airbnb faux pas. Overall a great experience though.  ,0
"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE
Courtney had cancelled our reservation a couple of days before the trip due to flooding in her apt - very understandable. The description of the work and floor did not seem as dangerous as it was. There were uneven, ripped up floors, ragged wood shards & exposed nails. There were building materials and ripped up carpeting in the living spaces. We were traveling with a 2 and 1/2 year old so this was very dangerous. We had to put blankets down to walk around. 
The main issue with the apartment was the cleanliness. Every appliance was dirty. Splattered food was in the freezer, refrigerator, microwave. Animal hair on the counters, pubic hair in the bathroom. The toilet hadn't been cleaned in who knows how long. Grease/butter/filth smeared on all doors of appliances. We had to clean just to stay. Our son I believe dropped a chip on the floor and husband accidentally tripped on the floor and broke a glass. (which we will pay for). This is not a comfortable space when we stayed.  We are working now on a refund.",0
"Absolutely loved this apartment! The place was exactly as pictured. Everything was super clean, and the back porch was great! Courtney left out toiletries in the bedrooms and bathroom, and coffee for the morning. Couldn't have asked for a better stay!",1
"Courtney was very friendly and welcoming from the day of booking.  She made getting into the apt very easy, and when we had an issue with the key she was quick to call back and help resolve the issue.  The apartment was great, very nice neighborhood and within Uber distance of all the great sights in Boston and in walking distance of many great parks, restaurants and bars.  My dog loved the house too - very dog friendly!  Only issue was that the bathroom was a bit dirty upon check in.",1
I had a great time with Lorin and Melissa! Brighton is a great neighborhood with lots to do and the room was comfy and as advertised. Would definitely stay here again!,1
"I had a wonderful time staying with Lorin in her adorable apartment. Her room is even bigger than it looks and very well kept. Plenty of hangers to hang up your clothes and lots of space if you're like me and tend to explode your suitcase the moment you walk in. The cats are sweet and cuddly and I wish I could take them home with me. The location is very safe and convenient to shops, restaurants and a few bars. I felt comfortable walking by myself at night to meet a friend. Lorin even accompanied me to dinner the second night, which I really appreciated  since I was traveling alone for work and was a total stress case. Overall it felt like I was staying with a great friend and she made everything super easy for me (even down to providing a handy welcome guide!).",1
"I stayed at Lorin's place for almost two weeks and it was a wonderful experience! Lorin was very friendly and made sure that I was comfortable during the entire stay. The place was clean and the room was pretty, well-kept, and the bed was so comfortable. The location was in a good area, with a short walk to many different bus stops plus lots of cafes, restaurants, and bars. Their two cats were also very affectionate and sweet. I had a great time and would definitely recommend staying with Lorin!",1
Perfect location in Brighton.  Super fun hosts that made me feel like I was hanging out with friends.,1
"I was very excited for my stay here and it could not have been more of a disaster. It was not accurately represented in the listing. The home was very old and the space was not clean. The neighborhood was sketchy. This place would be possibly fine for someone in their teens or early 20s. After staying one night here, I was able to move out per approval by Airbnb. The girls then proceeded to send me a passive aggressive, rude text message after I had left. They thought I locked one of their cats in the attic...I didnt even know there was an attic and the only cat I ever saw was the one that wouldn't leave my bed. I was left on the streets with 3 bags in the rain on my first night in Boston because I just could not stay there any longer. Cat food on the floor, a mess in the sink and in fridge...dirty dishes, dirty spoons laying around with cat food on them. The bedroom was riddled with photos of random girls. I felt like I was sharing a room with someone else. The home was old and dark and seemed to be a large house divided up so many times that there were possibly dozens of people under one roof. When I arrived, there were about 6 boys in their early 20s drinking topless outside the door. Felt like a frat party. Also this unit has a shared bathroom thats not near your bedroom, and your bedroom would be right in the living room. Very small space. The girls were out of town when I arrived and did not leave me with the internet code or any information but one towel full of cat hair on it. On the other side of the bed, there were pillows and things just thrown on the floor. Its like they didn't even clean the room. I paid a couple hundred more and found a much better place for me.... with no childish behavior from the host. Pains me to write this review as a fellow host myself but I would not want anyone else to be fooled into staying here.

Just as described. Very friendly people that greet you with open arms and a beer. ,1
Jennifer was wonderful and a great host! Her apartment was spacious and well-maintained. My mother very much enjoyed her stay here and it's location is so convenient with easy access to the C line and many downtown spots. ,1
"Despite arriving slightly early, Jennifer was extremely welcoming and her place is a fantastic base to explore Boston. One of the most comfortable pull out couches I have ever slept on. Thanks!",1
"Jane is a great host. This house was very spacious, clean and comfortable. Everything was perfect. Jane responded very quickly for all my messages. Jane is very friendly, attentive, helpful and very clear in all communications.I recommend this place to other people.

"We had a wonderful stay in this beautiful house. The location was perfect, right by the harbor and just minutes from little Italy. The house itself was spotless and comfortable. Jodi was a great host. She gave us very detailed descriptions on everything we needed to know from the minute we arrived. ",1
Jodi was a great host and her apartment was in a great location.  We enjoyed our stay and would love to stay with her again.  ,1
"Sam was always quick and most friendly to respond and perfectly arranged the check-in with his roomie Matt! Communication was easy. The apartment is located in a lively neighborhood full of college students, bars and restaurants, but it's in a quiet side street so we did enjoy our peaceful sleep. Thanks Sam & Matt!",1
Nice-sized room with balcony and lots of sunlight (windows on both sides of room) in a very well-laid out and tidy apartment. Host was very accomodating and polite. Very positive experience overall. Great price for the neighborhood. ,1
"above expectation and Sam is super friendly and Matt also. thanks for the hospitality.

Great,1
Nice neighborhood! Lots of things to do and great restaurants in the area. ,1
"Our hosts (Richard and Victoria) made us feel very welcome. They left detailed instructions for our stay, answered any questions we had,  and even left 2 bottles of wine for us to enjoy with our holiday dinners; such a thoughtful touch! They were just awesome; they kept in touch (via text messaging) to make sure that we were enjoying our stay and let us know they were available to immediately address any issue that may arise. The apartment was even better in person - super cute, clean, and comfy! It was also bigger than we thought it would be, with enough room for the 3 of us (me, my husband, and our adult son) to spend time together, but also for each of us to have our own space if desired. The apt had all the described amenities (2 flat-screen TVs, wireless internet, a fully-supplied kitchen, etc.). We all slept well; the beds were big, soft, and warm. The neighborhood was nice, very quiet with a suburban feel. This was our first experience with airbnb, and the bar has been set very high indeed! This was sooo much better than staying in a hotel. The apartment was absolutely perfect - literally a home away from home. We would stay there again in a heartbeat.",1
Host communicated well and was able to check us in earlier than 4:00pm arrival time. ,1
"Allston Red House was a lovely stay in a professionally managed super convenient Boston apt. Live like a native in premium , comfy, and spacious accommodations. Better than a hotel in many ways. Thanks for accommodating our late checkout and for the delicious welcome gift! Will send others your way! ",1
"Great apartment! Clean, warm, & inviting.  Charming and safe area - we felt at home from the moment we walked in.   Richard answered our questions via text or email as our travel date approached.   We would consider staying at Allston Red House again in the future!",1
"Our stay was amazing! The apartment is even better than in the pictures! It's perfect and Richard has thought of everything! It's a great location and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to stay in Boston! We'll definitely be back!

Thank you for everything and making our stay so great!

",1
"Stayed for the weekend with my parents. They shared the bedroom, I stayed on the day bed. The apartment is fantastic! Modern furnishings, clean, charming. Plenty of room for all 3 of us to have our own space. I would go back in a heartbeat!",1
"What a wonderful time we had staying in this brilliant apartment. The location was very convenient - we loved the restaurants and bars around Harvard Square and felt like locals at the end of our stay. The sights of Boston itself were all within easy reach by public transport and we made full use of our 7 day travel pass. Fabulous value!
The accommodation was spotless, comfortable, quiet and well-equipped. We enjoyed strolling around the neighbourhood, taking in the Halloween decorations on the porches. Thank you so much, Richard and Victoria, for your attention to detail throughout and especially for the thoughtful touches.",1
"we very much enjoyed our stay at the allston red house, it was a great space for my wife and i to stretch out and relax and it has been nicely renovated and meticulously maintained. richard and his wife manage their properties very professionally and make the process very easy and are accessible if necessary.  the suburb of allston was very convenient to HBS for us but is also a short hope into downtown boston.",1
This was So perfect!! We loved our stay here and would come again in a heartbeat!!,1
Richard was very accessible and responded quickly when we had a question. We loved our time there and would absolutely stay there again! ,1
"I highly recommend this house! The location was nice and very convenient. It was very easy to find and access into the house was very smooth. Every room and everything in the house is exactly what is in the pictures….if not better. The house was immaculate and there was a great abundance of towels, a couple robes, and slippers. The only bad part of staying here, is that it totally raised our standards and knew this would be tough to beat. Our next stop was NY and the house we are staying in now is no where close to the Allston house. I would go back to Boston just to stay at their house again!",1
"The accommodations were great: spacious, clean and very comfortable. Parking is a little hard to come by in the area (there are a lot of spaces on the neighbourhood streets, but also a lot of cars, especially at night), but that's par for the course in Boston, so that's not really a strike against the place. Richard was very good about maintaining contact, though all the instructions were pretty clear so I didn't really have to reach out to him often.",1
"My experience with Nathan is excellent, the place very well connected to the subway, clean, and  all facilities. Nathan is an excellent host,  attentive person, and very communicative from the begining. Nathan, I am looking forward to be a host in Spain for you and your family!!!  With not doubt I totally  recommend Nathan as an AirBnB host. My very best regards for Nathan!",1
Quite and peaceful neighborhood. Nathan is very helpful and responsive. 5 minutes walk to red T line and 10 minutes walk to Pizza place and Irish pub. ,1
The apartment is clean and very convenient to the subway station. Nathan is really friendly and helpful. He was always there if we had a question. I would recommend the apartment to everyone. ,1
"I stayed for a week in Nathan's home and it was an excellent experience. Upon my arrival, he gave me a tour of the home and also walked to me to the closest Train/Subway Station and got me acquainted with the area advised me as to where the super market was and local restaurants.  

The home was what I expected. Clean, charming,   Nice neighborhood. SUPER CLOSE to public transportation. This was my first trip to Boston and went extremely well. 

I would highly recommend staying in Nathan's home and will likely contact him again if I am in the area in the future. 

OHHH... And you can not beat the price!!! Very affordable but without sacrificing location or having to be in a dangerous neighborhood. :-)

A+++",1
"Pros: 1. great location-only 4 minute walk to the subway station. 2. Comfortable bed. 3. Air conditioner-really important in summer. 4. Really easy communication with the host.
Cons: 1. Have to live with 2 other renters, who might not be as tidy as you expected. Therefore, common places (bathroom, kitchen and living room) can be messy and even dirty. 2. You definitely have to be aware of what's around you between the subway station and the apartment even though this place is on much safer side the Dorchester. ",0
It was very nice and lovely experience and we might consider it again in the future.  Near the T station and close to the Star supermarket.,1
"The room is just wonderful. It simply had everything I need to live, work and enjoy life. I would stay there forever. The location is also completely awesome, it's 3 minutes away from metro station, what made all my travels fast and easy.",1
"Nathan was very responsive and accommodating for this stay. He made sure I had everything I needed, and the place was well furnished.

The location is very convenient to get into Boston using the Red T line, the station is within a 2 minute walk. I felt safe in this part of town, even at night.",1
The house/room is very good in terms of both location (2/3 mins by foot to T) and interior. Also Nathan takes good care and helped me move in.  ,1
"Listing was accurate and every detail is provided. Moreover Nathan is very prompt in replying to queries. Location is of extremely good. Walk to T in by 2-3 minutes. Quiet neighborhood and all amenities were taken care nicely and on time by Nathan, during all of my 6 months stay. ",1
"I booked a room at Nathan's place for my cousin to stay before she moves into college, Nathan and his wife were gracious hosts and prompt in communications about the rental. The house/room were clean and furnished. We were able to pick up the keys the night before as I was leaving Boston. ",1
"I was welcomed by Nathan, who showed me the apartment. The location is great: near JFK/UMass (red line), which brings you downtown in 10 minutes and to MIT/Harvard in 20-25 minutes. It is also near the beach, ideal for jogging or walking. I stayed for six months in this room and I had everything I needed. ",1
"Mr. Nathan is very hospitable and welcoming. The room and area where I stayed was nice, neat, and quiet, perfect for the reason I went to Boston to run the Marathon.  A great stay in Boston and wonderful experience with Airbnb.",1
Nathan was a great host. The room was very comfortable and he was easy to connect with and available for questions. I recommend him to others!,1
"Clean, comfortable room. Shared common area. Nathan was quick to reply to any concerns. Good value!",1
Great Experience. Nathan was there to greet me and ran me through all of the basics of things I needed to know to have a great trip. Great Host and was very comfortable in the apartment from the first moment ,1
Nathan was very accommodating and very clean environment and very centrally located in easy to get around could not have been a better experience,1
"I stayed at this address for 3 nights to attend a conference at the convention center in downtown. Location is great in terms of commuting to downtown, with grocery store nearby, safe and quiet neighborhood. Nathan is a polite landlord, he kindly let me check out a few hours late. One  caveat is that the apartment is not so clean -doors and walls of bathroom and kitchen apart from the floors need to be cleaned up. The bed and sheets, and the room I had  were all clean, though. I shared the apartment with two other roommates both were nice graduate students and busy with their internship. ",0
"This was my first Airbnb experience :) . Nathan is a really kind person and he is very welcoming. He was at the apartment to hand over the keys personally to me, showed the place around and helped me buy a pass at the train station. He answered all my queries immediately. The apartment is in a really nice location. Everything is just a hop, skip and a jump from the apartment including  grocery stores, restaurants and the TRAIN STATION. I shared the apartment with 2 other graduate students who are in town doing their internship, both of them were really sweet and kind. The locality is silent and safe. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed my stay and thanks to Nathan for making it a comfortable one! :) I would definitely recommend others to stay at his place!",1
"The location was great due to the proximity to public transit, grocery stores and other restaurant options. Nathan was a very responsive host and helpful in providing valuable tips and inputs. Had a very nice time in this house and it worked out great to attend a 3-day conference.",1
"It was my first Airbnb experience. Nathan is a very helpfull host! The location is very good, just a few steps to the subway. It was really nice!",1
Stay at James' place was good. But d sleeping arrangement were not up to the mark.  I told him clearly that we were 3 people.  He said 4 people can accommodate in the room. But the fact is that it was really trouble to sleep. The single bed and a couch were there. In fact 1 of my friend had to sleep on the floor.Rest it was good.,0
"James is very very nice, laid back.  The listing is just as it is presented in the pix.  James is very hospitably.  Located right next to T station so very convenient.",1
The room is good and James is a cool guy! Glad to stay here!,1
"My stay at Jameses place was amazing! The place is so arty and has its own chilling atmosphere. He had towels, oatmeals and coffee, so my morning was as usual as at home. He gave me his cord to connect my music to the stereo system which is kinda cool. I was driving a car so I got to park on street, which can be sometimes stressful, but i managed to find a place right in front of the entrance. We had a little chat in the morning and he advised me good places to visit in Boston. Thank you, James! Keep up with the good job!",1
James went out of his way to accommodate me and was extremely polite.  The room was the perfect size for two.,1
Super free space and nice host! I'll cone back here someday.,1
The toilet pretty clean and good location! The only think that I don't like is the door couldn't close well and the room quite dirty. ,0
James a very cool laid back guy i enjoyed my stay! Hospitality was a1,1
Super welcoming and understanding! Would definitely stay here again. ,1
James' place was just what we need. Confortable and clean. Very nice and people!,1
"Place looked nothing like what is portrayed in the picture. It was basically like a government owned social housing scheme in a very ruined down area. Along with this it was extremely dirty and had no privacy as the door cannot be locked and is in fact just a plank of wood and there was a girl living in the other bedroom in the flat. The toilet was like something you would see in a prison cell and the kitchen area consisted of 1 cupboard and a sink .

Myself and boyfriend didn't stay one night and had to find a hostel in Boston city. When we said it to the landlord he didn't seem to be bothered and just denied that the property had any faults and didn't offer any kind of compensation.

I wouldn't advise any person to take up this accommodation as you will be highly disgusted. I also have pictures of what the accommodation actually looks like if you would like to see them just contact me.",0
James gave us a key and let us unpacking quietly. It was nice. ,1
"Great host! The listing was as depicted in the profile, so no problem there at all. He was very helpful and kind, taking time to give us tips for the city. Would reccomend!",1
He was very welcoming and picked us up from the subway station. He also made sure that we had everything we needed to make us comfortable during our stay. ,1
"Location is very good. It is very close to the beach and subway, five minutes walk. There are some stations from the centre of Boston. Arrival time is flexible. It's very good. 
James is kind, intelligent and very hospitable person. When we rent a car and didn't find parking he helped us with this problem. It's one of some problems we faced to and James always helped us. 
We recommend James' place.",1
"James was a fantastic host.  Very laid back.  Wasn't too in your business.  Didn't have very strict ""time-in"" requirements.  He was just a very chill dude with a very convenient South Boston location that you can walk to pretty much anywhere from, had a lot of amazing insights into the local area and it's history, the culture, the people there, etc..  Really, this is the sort of place you stay at if you really want to get to KNOW the place you are visiting and going beyond the atypical tourist guidebook of things to do.  His price is also among the best in the city, especially considering that he does go above and beyond what most hosts (at least from my experience) do to leave their guests satisfied.  As for the actual room provided?  You get a huge tv with internet access to Netflix (accessed through a computer) and a hard and a soft futon to sleep on, pretty much what you see in that picture.  This is by no means luxurious but it gets the job that it needs done done: give the guest a place to sleep.  I didn't have much problem getting to sleep most nights that I was there.  Really, the lodging amenities matter very little compared to the hospitality of the host, the area around it, the people in that area, all of the sights within walking distance, and just the overall experience.  This is not the place to stay if you are one of those folks who likes to check into 20 story hotel and then pick up a tourist guidebook so you can see all of the sights.  I'd take this any day of the week over that and I'd definitely stay there again on my next trip.",1
"James is really a nice guy. His house is close to the subway station so it's really convenient. But the room door can't be locked. If you don't mind it, his house would be your smart choice.",0
"James is a good host and a nice guy. This was my first ever time AirBnB-ing but it was effortless. He got us the keys and left us to ourselves.

As described, the place is well located, near a station, and near the beach! It has a really good shower, clean towels, the bedroom has AC, wifi, and although we didn't use it, a huge TV!

We did also have a cockroach, and the door to the room doesn't really shut let alone lock, also the beds didn't feel particularly clean or comfortable. But to be honest most of that kind of stuff just comes from the fact it's a real old building in a well lived in estate.
Just putting this here to be totally honest.

Would recommend!",0
"James did a great job of communicating with my friends (there were four of us who arrived at two different times). The location was cozy with all of us, James estimation of the space being three comfortable, four if you're close, is accurate. :) So is his description of the neighborhood. For us it was very convenient, a short walk to the train station with all of our luggage (and a short run on the night that it rained!).  It was perfect for my friends and I to meet up and continue on the next leg of our adventure! ",1
"James is a really nice person, easy-going. The location of apartment is great, and the neighborhood is clean and quiet. I will definitely recommend this place!",1
"Perfect located place!
James is a nice guy, always replied my questions in a short period of time. 
The room is clean and the bathroom as well.
",1
"James has been an amazing host. He was punctual, helpful, social and kind. He responded quickly to my questions whenever I needed help or tips about Boston (even after my stay) and we had good talks about life. Accommodation had everything that my colleague and I required. The neighborhood was quiet and outside the city center but since the subway (redline) is 1 minute walk away, you'll reach South Station in 10 minutes. 
I highly recommend this place! ",1
"James is a gentleman. His unassuming, down-to-earth, and honest personality were his selling points. He is open-minded and willing to explore divergent views. His description of his listing as ""sufficient"" was accurate. He humbly accepted all improvement suggestions for his listing. He was quick to attend to my needs, displayed good hospitality, and respectfully offered suggestions when called upon to do so. We even went out to dinner and had very warm discussions with his friends. He provided good insights to the sites and sounds of Boston. This is one host that is highly recommended. I am sure to return.   ",1
"This place is a hidden gem! If you are really interested in experiencing real Boston neighborhood, there is no better place than this one. Easily accessible via JFK/UMass station of T-line, as well as conveniently near the calmness of the beach! We truly enjoyed our stay with James. He offered us plenty of useful insights to help us experience Boston better. I give five-stars and a thumbs-up to this listing. 
PS - I almost forgot about this. If you are in this room, do take time to appreciate the art behind James' paintings. What an amazing artist!  ",1
"Pros: not expensive considering Cost of living in Boston, easy to park a car nearby, we haven't seen James very much but his friend who helped him, Shawna, was wonderful with us. She even cooked os some delicious ribs and helped us find a good mecanic for our car, home is nearby a subway and a hubay station as well as a grocery, the room was according to the description and picture, but dirtier. We communicated easlily with James during the location as well as before.

Cons: the house was not clean, the biggest problem was the missing door: the room door was a wardrob door that couldn't even cover the door space, giving us absolutly no intimity, the description says theie is an included breakfast but it is a bit much to say since it was a large box of pieces of fruit, already old. You should know that the district is a bit odd but it is to be expected considering the location on the map and the price. ",0
Had a good stay at James' place. Place is exactly as described. Jame is a great host. We arrived early in the morning and he let us come drop our bags of and freshen up before the room was ready. Thanks for the stay.,1
very good,1
"James is a really nice person. He was very flexibel concerncing our arrival time, the room was ready for us and there was water and fruit in the fridge. He also answered all our questions.",1
The place was perfect for our visit.  Thanks!,1
"We had a great stay with James. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean and he was very willing to accommodate any needs we had.",1
James was very helpful and suggested nice places in the neighborhood for drinks and eats! He made sure someone was there to welcome us and we had towels ready and beds we're made :) I would definitely recommend it ,1
"James' partner welcomed us and showed us the room (two beds). It was really cozy and the big TV was great. Just a couple of minutes away from the beach and from JFK station with regular subway service to downtown. 
We had to call James two times before arrival and he always answered our calls right away. I can really recommend staying there.",1
The room is unexpectedly small. The missing door need to be fixed. The room was not that clean but the host is really nice. When I told him I will be arrived at 3.00 am he said I can come in immediately and stayed awake until I came and showed me the room. The location is really great. It took like 3 minutes walking to sub way. ,0
Stayed just for a few hours before catching a red eye flight back home. James was very quick with responses. We never got to meet him but Shawna was there to open the door. The neighborhood is not what I was expecting but we had no problems finding it. The room was a simple one bedroom. No door though in case your looking for complete privacy. They use a curtain. Was about 20 mins away from Quincy market. Good enough to stay for our purpose. ,0
"Cozy converted 3 ba 1 ba at west end area of Boston.  The decoration makes us feel fresh and bright, and it is close to piers, Cambridge as we ulber everywhere and it took within 15 min for every drive. In addition,  Elizabeth is  considerate and always provides first time response upon my question!  Will definitely recommend it to friends and stay at this apartment for our next trip to Boston.  ",1
"Short Review: LISA IS AMAZING! Stop looking anywhere else and stay here! The room is super clean, the neighborhood is safe and very near the T, and the breakfast and snacks were perfect! 

Longer Review: Before we arrived, Lisa was great with communication. She responded quickly (we had to book pretty close to the date) and she was able to get us in very fast. She was really sweet too by letting us check in a little early. When we arrived, there was amble free street parking and we noticed it was very VERY close to the T (only a 5-10 minute walk). 

Inside, the home is beautiful and very clean. The bed was sooooo comfy and the room provided us with everything we needed. Lisa was extremely friendly and helpful with getting around Boston. We had brought food with us, and being able to use the kitchen was awesome! They let us store food in the fridge and we made sure to clean everything we used. 

We even hung out with Lisa and Brian (her husband) a bit! 

Overall, I'd say book here... Immediately. :) We plan on staying with them any time we return to Boston!",1
The neighbourhood was great. Easy access to train (with metro pass provided) and on the border between two interesting areas. Felt very safe and cozy. Lisa met us when we arrived and the place was really clean and everything was provided including breakfast. It was very nice.,1
"Lisa is a fantastic host, very hospitable, giving a lot of local information and helpful tips which we really appreciated. The house is lovely and I would recommend this bnb to anyone visiting Boston.",1
"Wow what a great place to stay. Lisa is an awesome host both available & unobtrusive. The place is clean, comfortable and a GREAT VALUE. When I first looked at the listing I did not realize it comes with breakfast & subway/metro/train tickets for two people per room for no extra charge. And it is only a couple minutes walk to the subway/metro/train so we were in downtown Boston about 25 minutes after we walked out of her apartment building. My husband & I have stayed in a lot of Airbnb places and Lisa's was really great. Thanks!!!",1
"Lisa was a very welcoming hostess. The room was just as we expected, clean and with all facilities as described. It was a great base for spending a few days in a quieter part of Boston. Also, the home-baked cookies were really delicious! The travel passes are really handy - I definitely recommend a stay here.",1
"Lisa is a warm, welcoming host who clearly cares about her guests and wants them to have a great time in Boston. It is a great value considering the  quality of the accommodation and the location. This is a great place to stay if you enjoy meeting other travellers. There is a shared kitchen and common area which is very pleasant. The neighbourhood seems great and we enjoyed a few of the local pubs. Thanks again Lisa!",1
"This was a great bnb spot! Lisa was extremely welcoming and the room was very, very cozy. Freshly baked cookies were waiting in the room when we checked in (as well as those complimentary subway/bus passes). I highly recommend this place if you are visiting Boston!",1
"Comfortable, convenient and just as described. ",1
"Ten out of ten from us!! We arrived at Lisa's a lot later in the evening than we anticipated, due to flight delays that day. However, Lisa was so welcoming and took the time to show us through the house and explain everything we may need.  The room was perfect. So clean and tidy, chocolates and fresh towels, soft sheets, home baked cookies and snacks in the room. Their home is beautiful and we really were made to feel very welcome. There was plenty of brochures on Boston attractions and takeaway menus etc. Lisa was very helpful in offering advice on places to eat, things to see and the best way to get around. The complimentary travel cards they provided us were great, it meant we could enjoy the city without the hassle of organising that. The entire house was spotless, we couldn't fault a thing. It's close to the train station and a bus stop right outside was so convenient. Lisa also provides a breakfast each day which is just lovely. Fresh muffins, fruit, bagels, cereal, oatmeal, juice etc and a great little coffee machine which was SO GOOD!! The entire place was spotless, the bathroom even had a night light so you can find your way in the evening, a really nice touch. Overall, we couldn't fault a thing. We would have loved to stay longer. I'd would definitely recommend staying here. ",1
The list is accurate. Nice cozy friendly home.  Nutritious breakfast with variety of   choice  and yummy Lindor chocolate.  ,1
"The stay was great! Very comfortable bed, everything was clean and provided. They even made cookies, muffins and breakfast!! Very flexible about check-in and check-out, we could also use the free subway-pass until night time although we checked out early! Thanks for that! And there is free parking on the street and the subway is not far away, so it is easy to get to the city center! Very helpful hosts and recommendable to everyone :)",1
Lisa is a very nice and considerate hostess. She makes a warm and sweet home for us.....the bed is so comfortable! And the breakfast!!!! We'll definitely come again next time. Thanks Lisa and Bryant for this great experience in Boston.,1
Lisa was great and  a welcoming host. The location was convenient and clean. Would gladly book again. ,1
"Lisa, as host, excelled at her job. Rooms were as described. Beds super comfy. Snacks/water nice touch. Will definitely be back.",1
"Lisa was a wonderful host, the room was just as they described it, and while it's not close to downtown it is located close to the T. Plus they are kind enough to provide you with transit cards. Which is a nice bonus.",1
"Lisa made use feel right at home immediately, and helped us find our way into the city for a concert we wanted to attend. Although our stay was only one night, staying in the Sports Room with Lisa and Brian was exactly what we needed.
The T passes made transportation a breeze and Lisa has set things up so there are brochures and maps galore to help you find your way around Boston. There were even home made cookies in our room upon our arrival (thank you Brian).
We would recommend this to anyone coming to Boston for a visit. ",1
My sisters were overwhelmed by Lisa's hospitality and support. And have given Lisa FIVE star rating. ,1
Lisa was very hospitable and welcoming! Would definitely stay again. ,1
"I'm really really satisfied Lisa & brian's homestay. Cozy room, convient and clean bathroom, taste breakfast, free T ticket etc. . .
most of all, Lisa's bright smile makes me happy.
I want to recommend Lisa's house ro all people who visit Boston.",1
I had a great time with you!,1
"Lisa and  her husband were both great, very warm and welcoming.
I stayed for two days in the Sports Room, the room is clean and the bed is so warm, fresh towels, snacks and TV. Lisa also serve good breakfast every morning and the apartment is walking distance to the Arboretum.Transportation is very easy, close to T. I recommend Lisa's apartment in Boston. Thanks Lisa:)",1
It was really nice staying at Lisa&Brian's house. They invited us to their thanksgiving dinner and we would definetely recommend it to other guests. The bus stop is right across the street and takes you dire´ctly to the subaway station. From there you can go anywhere in Boston. ,1
"Lisa was amazing!
She made us feeling at home, offering us all we needed and giving us privacy as well.
The room is really good, exactly as it is on the photos.
The subway cards are great! You can get anywhere with them, a good thing for those who want to know the city.

Even when we almost burned the house with our midnight popcorn, Lisa and her husband were super nice with us.

If I go to Boston again, I'm sure I'm going to stay at Lisa's apartment.

Thank you for everything Lisa!

Diogo and Nathalia.",1
My girlfriend and I had not used AirBnB before. Lisa and her husband ensured that our first time would not be our last. I've used CouchSurfing and conventional lodging (hotels and the like) AirBnB was the best of both! Lisa responded to every question we had within minutes (seconds in some cases) which was amazing. I really couldn't find anything at all to complain about if you paid me to. Perfect!,1
Hospitality at its finest! Location is phenomenal for public transportation along with the use of the transportation passes.  Lodging met all expectations as described.  Truly enjoyed the stay along with the thorough and well thought out instructions and summary of places to visit during the stay. The communication was exceptional and truly appreciated at every step of my trip. I will definitely be looking to stay again the future!,1
"Lisa was a great host, made time to come meet us and show us the house, gave us tips for what to see and do, and was very friendly and accommodating. The room was as described, clean linens and good space. I especially liked the unlimited metro card. The snacks, breakfast and bottled water were a nice bonus. I would repeat with Lisa for sure. ",1
"If life brings you to the Roslindale/JP border, then you’d do well to stay with Lisa, Brian, and Kaiju the bearded dragon. They’ll go out of their way to make sure you and all their other guests feel comfortable and welcome. I have a weakness for both Cheez-Its and gummy bears, and there were two snack size bags of each of them waiting for me in my room. The room was nice and clean. The bed was simple but comfortable. The shower and bathroom got the job done. And it’s close to the ice cream wholesaler!",1
"We are a couple from uruguay, We spend 3 night there, We were out during the day, so We just enjoy breakfast and sleep at the house. Its really well located, near the center. The couple gave us metrocards, that was great really usefull!!! Home, specially rooms are comfortable and cozy. Breakfast esa really complete with all We need! Go red sox !!! ",1
"We enjoyed our stay in Boston and at the end of the day felt home at Lisa's place. She was very helpful and did well to answer our questions around the city. The accomodation is pretty the same as described, the photos are authentic. Be ready to share the common areas with other guests - this is not without any challenge, especially the bathroom. But on other hand great value and good offer.",1
"Fantastic host! 
I spend two nights stay in here and it was absolutely great stay.
She started to take care of us before we arrived. We could received travel information, popular spot in Boston and who will be in the room when we check in. All of these were very helpful.
The room was also clean and neat. She lent us a nice electric blanket. The location of this room was also great, you can get to the station either by bus or by 10 minutes walk.
Thank you for the every thing!
",1
Lisa was a wonderful host! I couldn't ask for a better experience :),1
We were very happy of how we were greeted by Lisa and her husband. The house location was great and the city pass was a nice bonus. Thanks again!,1
"Everything worked out very well.  The room was comfortable and the owners were great.  We had a good time chatting with Lisa & Matt and some of the other guests, although we were mostly away to watch the college hockey finals.  The close proximity to the subway system and the free subway cards that were part of the room deal were great for getting around.  The short bus ride wasn't a problem, and we felt very safe taking the short walk late at night when buses weren't frequent.",1
"Lisa and Brian were great hosts who really take pride in providing the best service possible for all guests!  It was clean, comfy, and pleasant. Also, there are so many great amenities at their house that really takes the stay to the next level. (Especially the T passes!) The area is also conveniently near public transportation that can take you all around Boston very easily.  We enjoyed our stay!",1
"A great stay with amazing, accommodating and kind hosts. Thanks so much!",1
"Thank you so much Lisa! We had a most pleasant stay at your house. Everything was great, and even though the house is not in downtown, it's really easy to access with the subway and the busses! Definitely recommand.",1
"Our first AirBNB experience and it truly exceeded our expectations! Five stars without a question. The Sports Room was really comfy, we loved the Subway passes and I could've spent the entire time in the TV room. At first the neighbourhood seems to be a bit far from downtown Boston but in about one day, when you've figured out the transportation system, it's so easy. The bus literally stops right in front of the house. Lisa is obviously an ambitious host and I would definitely recommend staying here! Thanks! ",1
"Lisa made us feel very welcome from the moment we got there. She allowed us to leave our bags before check in time and after check out time wich was really convenient. The snacks and bottle water left in the room was a nice gesture we greatly appreciated. The T passes a plus. The room was exactly like the picture, very clean and comfortable. Kitchen and bathroom spacious and clean. We did not have a chance to enjoy the rest of the house as we were out from early morning to late at night touring the city. Lisa was attentive to our needs and very helpful.
The Arnold arboretum was a pleasant experience, conveniently located and with a fascinating view of the city.
We loved our stay and would do it again and recommend it to family and friends.
Thanks again Lisa.",1
Absolutely awesome first airbnb experience. Thanks to Lisa for the hospitality! I will stay at Lisa's every time I head up to Boston now!,1
"Lisa was a wonderful host. Breakfast, unlimited train tickets, Lisa's hospitality and the location were the best parts about it! 30 min to downtown Boston, her house is literally a couple blocks to the Forest Hills train station which is extremely convenient! airbnb-ed a couple times now, and this experience was hands-down the best one yet. Would definitely love to be back!!

You'll love Lisa & her pet bearded dragon (who's harmless & super chill!) Kaiju. And this is coming from someone who's afraid of reptiles. 

P.s. Thanks Lisa, Natalia & I had a wonderful time. Hit us up when you come to New York!",1
"Staying at Lisa's was perfect, everything even better then described. You can have anything you can think of for breakfast, everything was arranged. We only wish we could have stayed longer!",1
"Lisa and Brian were amazing hosts. They went above and beyond what they were contracted to do. The place was clean, comfortable, and cozy. We had full access to the kitchen and even the washer and dryer. They gave us great ideas on what to do and where to go. The bus/subway pass they gave us was so helpful and welcome. And the fact that they are for California gave us something to talk about right away. They made our trip really memorable and we would definitely stay with them again.",1
"This was our first airbnb experience, and it was truly awesome, as were our hosts, Lisa and Brian. They made us feel very much at home without being in any way intrusive. The beds were comfortable, the coffee was good (very important!), and the free Charlie passes (which gave us three days of free bus and subway rides on Boston's public transit system) were an amazing bonus. Lisa also provided great recommendations about things to do and see, and places to eat, and went out of her way to draw us a walking route through Harvard's arboretum, which is very close by. Parking is on the street but was no problem at all, even when we got in after 11 pm. Everything was clean and fresh, and the price is so right--less than half of what the nearest Red Roof Inn out on the Mass Pike charges, and a whole heck of a lot better! Very highly recommended!",1
Lisa is really nice and helpful. We have clean room and free subway cards. It's a lovely house. ,1
"My Host made me feel very welcomed. Easy kitchen, to share. House rules, were  simple to follow. Modest accommodations, however, close to the Faulkner Hospital (15 minutes) by car, or within, walking distance. My room had air-conditioning, television, a desk and the bed was comfortable. 
~Lisa ",1
"Nice breadfirst , friendly host, unlimited transportation pass, everything exceed my expectation, 5 start bnb! Strongly recommend. ",1
"our host were there to greet us. helped us with luggage. We drove  to Boston from Philly that day and we were on a tight schedule to get cleaned up and head to a graduation function. They were great in explaining how to get where we needed to be . ,for that They got a 5 stars... thanks again.Our room was just great , Beds were comfy.Lisa was so friendly and helpful when we had any questions.I enjoyed my stay , and will recommend Lisa's hospitality to anyone traveling to th eBoston area.The transpiration pass was the bonus....Bus line to the orange line.The neighborhood was safe .",1
"We had a great week end at the Sport Room! We were welcome very well. Everything was clean and there were lots of facilities. The bus and train pass was very usefull. 
I highly recommend the place. 

Nous avons été très bien reçus à la Sport Room. C'était très propre et il y avait plusieurs commodités. La passe de métro fut particulièrement bienvenue. ",1
"It was such a great experience I had in Boston! Lisa is very welcoming and easy going. She set up a portable bed to accommodate three of us as my parents were traveling with me. She is very considerate and texted me in advance asking me if my parents have food allergies so that she can prepare breakfast for us. We arrived late due to traffic issue, but Lisa was very patient and stayed up late waiting for us. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND people stay with Lisa.",1
Lisa was great and available for any assistance needed. The location is easy for public transport. My first Airbnb experience and I'm sold!,1
"he sports room was a great inexpensive option for us. The beds were comfortable and room big enough to accommodate both of us and our luggage fairly comfortably. Room was very clean. Aircon and heating worked well (weirdly, we needed both!!). Parking wasn't too hard, even my parallel parking phobic husband was able to get drive in spots without too much of a bother. The Charlie cards were a huge bonus, and given the house is literally at a bus stop, and a very short walk to the Orange line, we used them all the time. Very easy to get into the city- most of the main stops are on the one line, and because the house is on the last stop, it's simple getting home too. The shower is lovely and super hot, and kitchen had all the basic cooking gear you needed for a night in. Wifi was very quick and we never had any issues with dropping in or out. It is more of a boarding house than description suggests- apart from a private section out back, all the other rooms (two floors in one house) are guest rooms, which was a little disconcerting for boarding newbies like us. Still, there are two bathrooms and we only really had to wait a few times in the mornings. Overall, given the price of hotels, and taking in account the massive saving of the free charlie card, this was a fantastic value option and one I would recommend as long as you are okay sharing your space!",1
My parents loved the stay. Room and bathroom were clean. Having a subway nearby really made the stay convenient for my parents. Definitely would recommend!,1
"If you ever go to Boston, I recommend you stay in this Airbnb! The room was as listed, the metro cards came in handy, the hosts were extremely helpful and friendly, and most importantly: Whatever little extra-wishes we had, Lisa made them all come true! ;-)

",1
Lisa is sweet and helpful. And the place is convenient to Boston. The room is clean and enough for two person. There are a lot of choice for breakfast! Great value!,1
"Lisa is so nice and considerate!!!! the place is really cozy and clean!!!
Highly recommended host in Boston:)",1
"Just like home.  Lisa and Brian make their space your place.  Lisa is available and helpful for everything! Transit passes made our travels to the Freedom Trail and Harvard a breeze.  We enjoyed the COOP on the way to the train station for Kambucha refills and treats.  Neighborhood is nice.  Cereal and toasts, and fruit etc...available for b-fast or in our case an evening night cap. Arboretum behind house is a great cut through.

We don't watch TV much at home, therefore a nice treat to be able to enjoy shows I never watch at home esp, after walking 10 miles each day!    All and all a great space.",1
"Lisa was very responsive via text messaging, and made us feel welcome upon our arrival.  The double room was as expected, and has its own AC unit, which was really nice on 2 warm June nights.
The excellent values here are 1) the breakfast provided, with coffee, juice, eggs that you can cook, etc.; and 2) two Metro passes provided with the room, which we used a lot.
Great visit to Boston.",1
We had a great weekend in the accommodation of Lisa and Brian. We were welcome very well. They made their home to our place. Everything you needed was there if it was for cooking or information avout boston e.c. My friend didn't have an umbrella so lisa borrowed him one. The room was very clean and we got some free snacks as welcome-gift. The location is easy located to the public transport. The free public transport passes were a nice extra and very useful for make sightseeing in Boston. The Wifi worked very quick and we didn't have problems with the connection. The breakfast was great a lot of choices. It was my first airbnb-experience and i would totally recommand to stay by Lisa and Brian.,1
Lisa was awesome as a host. Both her and Brian made our short stay very welcoming. The rooms were very clean and was well stocked. It even had a white noise machine!!! ,1
A vary convenient room both in terms of its amenities but also in terms of its location. Hospitality was suburb. Hosts were always available to help.,1
We couldn't have been happier with our first Airbnb experience! Lisa was the perfect hostess and did everything she could to answer any questions we had to make our first trip to Boston amazing. The room and house are simple and cozy and what a treat to have fresh baked cookies when we arrived! The kitchen was well stocked and having the bus/train passes available for our use were priceless and took away the stress of trying to drive in a new city. We felt like we were staying with friends and when we come back to Boston we will definitely be booking with Lisa and Brian again! ,1
Lisa was great. My brother and I were very comfortable staying in Lisa's home. The two unlimited train and bus passes were a major help to get to Boston and back. I will definitely stay here again when I'm back in town again.,1
Pleasant and welcoming. Lisa was great at letting us know details and information about Boston. ,1
"We had a wonderful time staying in the Sports Room!  Lisa was an amazing host and went above and beyond to make us feel at home. Cookies upon arrival, breakfast, snacks, games, movies, recommendations on what to do in Boston, transit passes, and the cleanest (URL HIDDEN) detail went unnoticed.  We loved exploring Boston and having such a pleasant place to return to each evening.  Highly recommend! Five stars!",1
"Fantastic experience, very accommodating and really enjoyed the breakfast and to go cups for morning hot tea. Loved the location, walked through the arboretum on the way to the subway! The subway passes were super helpful as well. ",1
Great location.  5-10 minutes walk from the green line.  Your room locks and there is a shared kitchen. Totally recommend.  ,1
"Nice and comfortable room but noise from the street, you can use the kitchen and all what you want, Lisa tries to answer all your questions. 
Easy to go to the downtown (bus and metro).
Drink, food, metro-passes and all informations are great.
Thank you from Belgium.",1
"It was a short trip and we just stayed one night in Boston but it was really a pleasure stay! The sport room was amazing, every where looks clear and comfortable. The house is just beside the metro station. Lisa is a really kind host.  ",1
"Lisa and Brian were very attentive and responsive to making sure I felt taken care upon registration as their guest and thruout my stay.  The space looked and felt exactly as described and was clean and comfortable, which were important to me as a first time airbnb user.  The hosts paid attention to small thoughtful details in each of the guest rooms and the shared bathroom and kitchen that made sure it felt like home and gave great value for the price.  Including the free subway passes. Getting to downtown was only 25 mins door to door and very easy with frequent bus connections right in front their door. Loved having my own tv in the Sports room. Just like a hotel room but cosier.  Air conditioning was great during the hot and humid Boston weather.  Would definitely stay here again if back in Boston.",1
"Staying at the Sports Room was a fantastic experience. Our host Lisa was very accommodating, letting us leave luggage there after we checked out and giving us lots of useful information about the neighborhood and Boston in general. The neighborhood itself was nice, albeit quiet. We also received subway passed for our stay which was excellent. Overall, we would definitely recommend!",1
"Had a great trip!  Lisa was very helpful and easy to communicate with via text/email.  She greeted us with a smile, showed us around the flat, and gave us some great site seeing tips. It was a short trip for us but we will be visiting again. Thanks for everything.",1
Lisa is a very thoughtful and considerate host. She and her husband were very welcoming and went above and beyond to make our stay as comfortable as possible. The room was clean and private. We recommend this room to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay in Boston on a budget. Thanks Lisa!,1
"Lisa and her husband are the best hosts ever and very sweet people! The way they have set up their house to receive guests is absolutely amazing. They go above and beyond to make your stay the best possible. The beds are extremely comfortable, there is AC and a big TV in the room. The room is very clean and they even leave Lindt Truffles on the towels as well as snacks on the desk. To make your stay even better they have unlimited Charlie Cards that guests can use for no extra charge (a big money saver and very convenient)! The location is amazing because a bus stop is right across the street and that takes you to the Forest Hills Train Station down the road (on foot it is around a 10 minute walk) giving you access to the entire Boston area. There is breakfast available every morning. They are so considerate as to even put a shampoo and conditioner dispenser in the shower if you forget yours at home. Their place has a very homey atmosphere and I highly recommend it to anyone staying in Boston. It was truly a pleasure to stay there.",1
"This was my brother and I's first AirBnB experience, and we were very pleased! Lisa was the perfect hostess! Everything was ready when we came, she gave us a tour of the apartment, and had fresh chocolate chip cookies and snacks waiting in our room upon arrival! She also gave us a list of places her husband and her recommend. The Charlie cards were a great addition and we used them several times while we were there to go down town on the T. We slept very comfortably in the twin beds! Absolutely a wonderful experience and Lisa is a fantastic host! I would definitely recommend staying here!",1
Lisa was a great host to our stay! She helped us a lot giving us information about the city. Complimentary transportation card saved us so much money! Thanks Lisa!,1
"Lisa was a great host; we felt very welcome and would absolutely stay there again. It feels like a bed and breakfast or hostel, as there are multiple guest rooms. The free Charlie passes are awesome and the T is a short walk from the house. Breakfast and tea/coffee in the morning is great, too. Lisa also had a bunch of suggestions for us to make the most of our short time in Boston. ",1
"Lisa was a super accommodating host who did everything in her power to make our stay very comfortable and great. The room was exactly as described, and very clean. Subway/bus system was walking distance and we were able to get into downtown Boston without issue. I highly recommend this location.",1
"Gracious host, great place, more amenities than most hotels. These two should be the model for any Airbnb. Phil",1
"Lisa was amazing! My friend and I arrived at her house around 12.30pm and she was really welcoming. She showed us around the house and answered to all the questions about the city. 
Then we went around the city and when we came back she had our room all set up. With clean sheets clean towel, water bottles and a little chocolate for us. 
In the evening she left us the kitchen to cook something. The next morning she's been really helpful with places where we should go and what we should do. 
The metro passes were really helpful and made us save so much money. 

She's just been amazing. ",1
"It's been a really nice experience to stay in Lisa's home.  My mom and I really enjoy the lovely breakfast. Free CharilieCard really brings us convenience. The traffic here is pretty convenient and easy to remember, any buses can direct the T station, pretty easy for the downtown. What's more, as a freshman, to begin a new life in the new country is confusing, but Lisa really helps me a lot! If my friends coming to Boston next summer, I'll definately recommend them to stay here! ~",1
"I booked Lisa's apartment for my brother and cousin visiting me from Germany. Although they just stayed over for one night they felt really comfortable. How Lisa cares as a host is really honorable.
The room was nice and clean and exactly how it's shown in the pictures. What's awesome as well is the opportunity for breakfast. The only thing is that it tends to be kind of loud in the house, but Lisa bought a ""noise maker"", which is really cool.

I can highly recommend this room for every age and the public transportation is amazing as well.

For german visitors: Ich bin ein deutsches Au Pair in Amerika und hatte meinen Bruder und meine Cousine zu Besuch. Lisa als host ist extrem hilfsbereit und immer erreichbar, zu dem ist sie auch flexibel was das einchecken angeht. Das Zimmer ist genauso wie auf dem Foto, sehr sauber und gemütlich. Das Frühstück bietet alles was man braucht und auch die sanitären Anlagen sind sauber. In der Nacht kann es sein, dass es ein wenig lauter wird im Haus, aber das ist nicht immer der Fall. Definitiv an alle Altersgruppen weiter zu empfehlen!!!",1
We had a fantastic experience with Lisa and Brian!  They were very helpful and the place was exactly as described.  I would highly recommend people to stay there when travelling through Boston area.  It's a great location and it was a great having access to the bus/train passes (very helpful!),1
"Fantastic place, fantastic hosts, better than a 7 star hotel! I offer to EVERYONE, spend as many nights as you can at this lovable place with these delightful hosts! I loooved it!",1
"What a great first experience with Airbnb!  The neighborhood is awesome with tons of restaurants and bars, the accommodations were exactly what we were looking for, and Lisa is the consummate host.  It felt like a bed-and-breakfast, with spacious common areas, a kitchen stocked with a wide variety of breakfast options, and friendly co-guests.  

Lisa is extremely friendly and very helpful around where to go, things to do, and how to get around.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.

 ",1
"I would recommend staying with Lisa & Brian without any hesistation! The house is easy to get to, and the free transport passes (charliecards) were a huge help! Lisa was very accomodating, and easy to talk to. The house was lovely and some snacks were provided. This was my first experience of using AirBnB, and it by far exceeded my expectations!!",1
it's clean and tidy.The hoster took a lot care of us and gave a suprise to me. There are some nice snacks and nice people in the house. Thank U : ),1
"Great host! Lisa and Brian were the best. They made us feel at home from the moment we've arrived! Brian made some delicious wafels, and Lisa bakes delicious cookies. The room was fine as well, comfy beds, and the fact that they've arranged some free public transport tickets makes the stay more than worth it.  ",1
Wonderful stay and very friendly hosts.Super close to public transportation.,1
"Lisa was amazingly accommodating and made us feel very welcome. We arrived later than expected at her place but she provided us with clear instructions on how to get to her place and there were several amenities above and beyond the average airbnb, including breakfast, cookies, maps/info on the area, etc. Would definitely stay here again; thanks Lisa!",1
The neighborhood was nice and I felt safe. Room was clean and house was homely. ,1
Lisa showed us around all the facilities. The neibourhood was fine! We walked around in the morning and people we met were kind and friendly.,1
"Lisa was a great host ,friendly and helpful. Room was clean and big enough. It was great stay in Boston.
highly recommend.",1
The neighborhood was close to a subway station.  The listing is accurate. Lisa was very accommodating with our requests and helpful with our questions.,1
"Lisa was an excellent host. She was waiting for us when we arrived to welcome us and show us around her property. The apartment is conveniently located across from a bus stop and about a 10 minute walk from the train station (orange line). Overall, I couldn't have been happier to stay here.",1
"Lisa has made my first bnb experience joyfully. The house is not far from the subway station and I can always find seat on train since forest hill is the start of orange line. Lisa is very organized and will always happy to offer suggestions.
We also enjoyed the cookies made by Lisa. Very yummy!
Kanju is such a quiet roommate and we have been the audience to learn how he takes the breakfast.
Lisa, I wish you can run another bnb in the west in the near future. I am looking forward to experiencing again.",1
We really enjoyed our stay at Lisa's house. She was very friendly and assisted us with any queries we had. She was very informative about things to do in Boston and our visit went a lot smoother because of it. The free travel passes made our stay much more hassle free and were a very nice touch from Lisa!,1
"Lisa made us feel very welcome when we arrived and during the stay. She was around so we were able to ask her questions and get further information about Boston. The neighbourhood was nice amd quiet, very accessable by public transport. The free passes were a huge plus. Highly recommend this option!",1
"Lisa and Brian were delightful and engaging hosts. The little gestures like freshly-baked cookies on arrival, lots of free maps and guides and the movie screening room with free popcorn really made us feel like valued guests. The breakfast is also fantastic. The house is in a bohemian neighbourhood with interesting restaurants, and though there were other guests it never felt busy or crowded. I'd definitely stay again!",1
"Lisa was exceptionally helpful and welcoming - I couldn't ask for more from an Airbnb stay.  Good provision of food for breakfast and snacks, with drinks available any time.  Convenient for getting into Boston on the Orange Line with multiple buses stopping at the front door.",1
"We really enjoyed our stay in Boston, Lisa was very nice and welcoming. She really helped us tu have a great stay.",1
LIsa was most friendly and welcoming.  The accommodations are as described.  I found the bed to be very comfortable and the setting relaxed.  I liked having kitchen privileges and there is a food and drink available to guests around the clock.  Very convenient to public transportation and I was able to park right in front of the house.     ,1
Thanks for a great stay!,1
A really nice and sweet house! Many thanks to Lisa! The subway passes are amazing! And the breakfast was a fresh start for our days in Boston.,1
Lisa is a good host and we did have a lot of fun here!,1
Very hospitable service. She made us feel at home. The breakfast was the pleasant surprise. ,1
"Facilities are Clean and the host is friendly too.
We had a great night there! ",1
"Lisa provided everything you could think of - and not think of! There were so many extra touches in the room that were a pleasant surprise: water and snacks, ear plugs, a desk and writing utensils, a white noise maker, shelves, and universal phone charger! The included train/bus passes were a super nice amenity as well. It seems the ""breakfast"" part of bed and breakfasts are often left out of AirBnbs, but there were plenty of breakfast choices: muffins, cereal, eggs in the fridge, toast, coffee, tea, etc! 
We loved the walk around the Arnold Arboretum that was right behind the apartment.  It was also a convenient spot near the end of the orange line.  ",1
"We had the greatest experience staying at this Airbnb. My son and I needed a place to stay so he could attend a college tour. Lisa made us feel welcome immediately, spending time telling us about places to explore in the city, and how the subway system works (it's a 10 minute walk and then a 20 minute trip into the city center - Lisa provided the passes). She also provided a great make-it-yourself breakfast and plenty of snacks. And finally, Lisa told us about and gave us a map of the beautiful Arboretum that is very near to her Airbnb. We spent a lovely fall Saturday morning walking in the Arboretum - one location has a great view of downtown.  It was a lovely stay - thank you!",1
Lisa was very welcoming and nice. The space was accurate and exceeded our expectations. They are even snacks!!! The neighbourhood is safe and public transport is easy to access. We really enjoyed Boston and definitely stay at Lisa's place again.,1
"Lisa was an excellent host. My friend and I both loved her pet bearded dragon Kaiju, and Lisa let us play with him upon our arrival. The room was exactly like the picture and there was a magnetic dartboard which was fun to play with. Although my friend and I were persistant tourists and decided to brave Boston's frigid autumn weather, if you decide you'd rather stay in, there are a ton of games available, the movie projector downstairs, and a rather large tv in the Sports room as well. The Charlie cards were extremely convenient and we used them the entire weekend. Lisa was also very understanding when we overslept on our last night.",1
Lisa was very welcoming.  The room was as it was described and even had chocolates on the bed. The living room was open for movies and the kitchen was well supplied.,1
"I would have given 6 stars if there was the option!  Everything about the stay here was wonderful.  Lisa & Brian are spectacular hosts, very friendly, and did not hesitate to share information of how to navigate the city.
I had breakfast with other guests that were staying there, all of whom were friendly and kind.
The apartment had everything that we needed for an extended weekend stay.
The neighborhood is a nice working class area.  Everyone I spoke to on the streets were pleasant and offered information as where to locate various places.
The buses & trains were a breeze to manage and very convenient for accessing the city.
This was my first Airbnb experience, and I feel that the bar was raised quite high by Lisa & Brian.  
I would highly recommend staying here to any of my friends & family.

"Really nice people and really nice house. My friend and I had a great time here, the transportation is convenient, everything is great. ",1
"I felt home when I stepped in this unit. Everthing was well-prepared. So much of entertainment provided but too bad we could'nt enjoy them since we were in a rush. Lisa gave us a warmful welcome when we arrived, showing us every corner of her house. We love the food prepared espcially during breakfast time. If I would have the chance to come back again, Lisa house is still my first choice.",1
I felt like home at Lisa's place. The posting describes everything well. ,1
It was a great experience it was a great welcome and a lovely home . ,1
"Lisa's great! Very professional and friendly, it's obvious she's done this for a while. As a huge bonus, she also stayed up late no problem -- my flight got in after midnight and she made sure I was able to check in ok. Really, really good experience!",1
"My best friend and I stayed with Lisa and Brian for about a week. The room was amazing and had a ton of storage. They were friendly and great, it was so easily accessible by public transit and the passes made it amazingly easy to see parts of the city we had never dreamed of seeing. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else in Boston. ",1
"This was my first time ever using Airbnb, and I truly feel that I lucked out. Lisa and Brian have a cute little set up, and all of the little touches helped the experience feel like staying over a friend's house. Thank you for everything!",1
"Very nice place, friendly people. Recommended for sure!",1
"My daughter and I absolutely LOVED staying here.  Lisa made us feel incredibly welcome, even when we got in much later than expected.  She had everything you could possibly want available, and the public transportation could not have been more convenient (literally right outside the door).  The bearded dragon fashion show was an added bonus. :) Thank you for a wonderful night! ",1
"lisa was so hospitable and helpful! She prepared all things needed for a trip like city subway map and charlie cards and she generously let me use the kitchen whenever. She gave answers to all of my questions, It was a easy and comfortable trip to Boston with Lisa's help! I definitely will recommend this place to my friends!",1
"The host was very welcoming! She told me exactly how to get into the house and where to find my room. Once I got there I found a super clean room, comfy beds, and all the snacks I could want. :) I later got to meet my host, who was absolutely wonderful (and offered peanut butter cookies). The bathroom was great, as was the location: super close to the Orange Line. It was the perfect spot for my one night in Boston!",1
"Lisa and Brian were absolutely fantastic hosts! They provided us with tons of tips and suggestions for things to do in the city. The transit passes were very convenient and the room was clean, comfy and welcoming. They really went out of their way to ensure we were comfortable and were extremely accommodating when our flight home was cancelled. This is the best Airbnb I have ever stayed in and I would recommend it to anyone! Just a fantastic experience all around!",1
"This was our first time using air bnb and it was everything we could have asked for. Lisa and Brian were absolutely amazing. Couldnt have asked for any more. The subway passes were perfect and really helped us get about the city.

If we ever come back to Boston we will drfinitely be staying here.

Thanks again Lisa :)",1
"Enough said! First and the best Airbnb  experience yet. Thanks Lisa and Brian for taking care of us. You have become our official Boston hosts. We will surely come back.
Highly recommend! :)",1
Comfortable twin room in a calm and cosy neighbourhood. Lisa and Brian were very kind people and think of everything for making your stay brilliant. Breakfast was great and the coffee machine was fab! Couldn't recommend more. The travel passes save you loads too.,1
"Lisa was very friendly, welcoming and helpful.  Our room was comfortable and the house is convenient to public transportation so that I didn't have to drive my car into Boston.  The added perk of Charlie Cards and T map was very generous.  It was also nice to be able to walk to a delicious Indian restaurant that evening for dinner.  The downside of all this convenience however, is city background noise that we (as country bumpkins) are not used to, so sleeping was difficult.  But I would certainly recommend this place to others looking for a convenient, comfortable place to stay in the area. ",1
"Lisa and Brian were wonderful hosts for my friend and I. She welcomed us warmly, gave us clear information about how to get around Boston, made us feel at home, and enchanted us with her bearded dragon's costume changes. The listening with accurate, the space adorable, the kitchen was very accessible and had all we needed plus some, and the entire trip was all-around WOW, and we'd stay with them again in a heartbeat!!!!",1
"We had a wonderful time with great host.  We could have not asked for better host.  If ever we are back in Boston, we would never stay anywhere else!  From the breakfast, subway cards, informational help, etc was excellent.  Thank you for everything!",1
"lisa is so nice,we could have access to everything.the cookie is greats also.she also prepared metro pass to guess that's a big advantage for us to going around city.",1
"This was my first Airbnb experience and it couldn't have been more rewarding.  Lisa and her husband Brian made me and my son feel welcome from the time I made the reservation.  And when we arrived at her place, I realized this was a real HOME.  All the little touches made the experience special:  the complimentary mass transit passes, access to the kitchen, complimentary breakfast, the Lindor truffle on the bed, and a plate of home-made chocolate chip cookies.  Add to this the convenient location, and it added up to an A+ experience.  When traveling to Boston in the future, this will be my first choice.",1
Lisa and her husband were great! the room was a great space and had everything we needed. They also suggested a great pub for food and drinks. The neighborhood felt very safe and my friend and I walked around at night comfortably. We only needed to stay one night but would love to return in the future. ,1
We so appreciated Lisa's place for our short stay in Boston. Everything was as described. The transit passes were great and we got a good Indian dinner just down the street.  It can be hard to find places with 2 twin beds - that was what we needed. I'd recommend these accommodations to anyone!,1
This was the best host and room ever thank you  a lot Lisa,1
"Very nice and helpful people, everything was perfect I would definitely came back there ! It was a pleasure to be your guest guys ! :)",1
"Me and my fellow backpacker really enjoyed staying at Lisa's! The room was nice and clean, and the Lisa made our arrival very comfortable! 
We will definitely recommend everyone to stay at Lisa's! 
We would love to be back! ",1
"Very warm and welcoming environment.  The room was clean and nice.  The host, Lisa, was very friendly and helpful.  Loved the location - on the bus line and close to the T.  The free public transportation pass is an awesome perk.  We had a great stay!",1
"Lisa listing was exactly as described and was a great host. The apartment was spotless and extremely inviting. Lisa made it a point to make me feel at home, leaving fresh baked cookies and Lindor chocolate, and clean sheets/towels for my visit. She was easy to contact and communicate with when I needed but allowed me to use her own apartment as if it was my own privacy wise. She even introduced us to her cute lizard and did a little dressing show for us :)  I highly recommend Lisa on Airbnb and hope to rent from again in the future. Well done!",1
The sports room was a great spot to stay in Boston. The close proximity to the subway and the free passes provided made for getting around the city a breeze. Lisa is very welcoming and a great host. I would highly recommend a stay when you are in Boston.,1
"Lisa and Brian were great at making us feel at home for our first AirBnB trip. They offered several suggestions to try while we were in the area, including some places we would never have considered beforehand. Bus/ subway passes were a HUGE advantage as we traveled all over the city, and the nearby subway station certainly helped. The rooms were well taken care of and breakfast was tasty. Would certainly consider if planning on visiting again.",1
"We had such a nice quiet stay at Lisa's house. She takes care of everything to make the visit experience great. She recommended us some places to visit and the way to go there. Her place is so nice and the location is very good.

I appreciate the time I spent in her house. Thank you Lisa!

Hope to come back soon!",1
"Lisa was great and booked us in for a last minute one-night-stay in Boston. She helped us out with travel plans, not to mention the free travel passes, and shaved a great deal of travel time for our trip to Fenway! Many thanks for allowing us to leave our bags after check out too. That was super helpful and saved us a lot of time and money. Highly recommend!",1
"Wonderful stay! Great host! Very convenient spot to travel downtown Boston. Thanks for everything, Lisa.",1
"Our hosts Lisa and Brian made us feel very welcomed. We had a wonderful time. They provided us with many useful resources and made sure all of our needs were met. Since we were unfamiliar with Boston, Lisa took the time to describe the city to us. She gave me many useful tips for when I will be actually moving here. Lisa and Brian are located in a very safe area. My mom and I felt safe walking around the area even at night. They are two very nice people and I highly recommend staying with them!",1
Lisa was a great host. The house was lovely and I would stay here again. ,1
The room is in an older house typical of Philly and boston areas. Convenient to downtown and while the street was busy it seemed like a safe neighborhood. I parked my out of state suburban with no problems. I enjoyed chatting with Lisa and meeting their bearded dragon!!! The was another couple also staying there but I didn't hear a thing from anyone in the house. (I was also very tired). place was clean. bed was comfy. air conditioner pumped air from outside for me as the night was cool. great community style place to stay.,1
"Lisa is awesome! This is the most accommodating airbnb host I've ever had. They had goodies for us in our room, free breakfast and coffee, free food in the fridge, a movie room with a popcorn maker, and of course free transportation passes, which makes everything much easier. They also introduced us to their awesome bearded dragon, Kaijo (?). They were super friendly and did not make us feel unwelcome at all. 6 out of 5 stars. ",1
 We really enjoyed our stay. I give it 5 stars! The public transit passes were a really nice touch. ,1
My experience was wonderful!,1
"Lisa was a wonderful host. The room was clean and comfortable, there were even snacks and a chocolate. She also provided kitchen facilities and a great breakfast set-up. The passes for the subway were greatly appreciated. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in Boston.",1
"Even though I was attending a late reception, Lisa and her husband were awaiting my arrival and showed me about, explained how everything worked, and offered free transport passes. She and their lovely home are models for the concept and functionality of AIRBNB. The room is large, equipped with large screen TV, Lisa has charge plugs for every know device, and the air conditioner in the unusually high Boston temperatures was a blessing.",1
"The sports room like the rest of the house was very clean and equipped with all the amenities needed. The kitchen had food for us, a coffee machine and clean dishes. Lisa also had maps of the city ready for us as well as a Charlie card to use the subways and buses while we were touring Boston. All in all, it was a great experience with very welcoming hosts, exactly we were looking for in a weekend trip.",1
"Lisa was very helpful and nice and she had thought of everything we might need :)
Nice neighbourhood, the trains and buses were many and the distance to the city centre was not too far.
The house become really a home even if I stayed there just for a few days. 
",1
"Lisa was the perfect host, she offered everything we needed and wanted. The place was lovely and clean with fresh sheets, perfectly and accurately described on the listing. It was very convenient having the free transport passes which allowed us to travel around the city completely hassle free! All in all it was a great experience, I thoroughly recommend staying here and I hope to be back soon!",1
We had a wonderful stay. Lisa and Brian were the perfect hosts.  They have done a lot of research to make sure their place is comfortable. It is a short walk to the subway so we could easily enjoy Boston. I highly recommend their place!,1
"Lisa was a wonderful host, very kind , courteous, helpful and informative. Place was clean and close to the T so it Made for easy travel. Definitely would recommend for anyone.",1
"This was a fantastic place to stay. They have everything that you could want or need, and were great about providing us with information about Boston for our travels. The transit cards were a huge bonus- and they are a 10 minute walk from the train station! I'm very glad we booked with them, and would do so again in a heartbeat!",1
"Lisa was very prompt in answering our emails and text messages. She accommodated our request to drop off our luggage before the check in time and met us at the door when we arrived.

The room we stayed in was clean and Lisa delivered fresh towels and linens promptly upon request. The kitchen had fresh fruit, cereal and coffee available among other things. Lisa is a baker and leaves cookies and pastries around which was nice.

I met a few of the other guests staying there which was fun. One young lady was from a city in Australia not far from where I visited many years ago. We had fun talking in the kitchen one morning over fresh coffee.

The bonus feature of the stay with Lisa was the Charlie Cards she provides. They gave us unlimited access to  the very convenient public transportation system. Catching the bus was right across the street. Getting to downtown Boston was easy to navigate and there are always friendly people around to help with directions if needed. We usually had less than a 6 minute wait for the next bus or train and never more than 10 minutes.

The next time I travel to Boston I will no doubt stay at Lisa's awesome AirBnB.",1
Lisa's place is great. The neighbor is quiet and safe. Lisa is a very hospitable and generous host. The house is a bit old but it has everythinf I need. Thanks Lisa!,1
Lisa was a great host! There's a kitchen full of food for guests along with the free subway/bus passes and other amenities.  She also dressed up her bearded dragon Kaiju for us which was HILARIOUS. We were able to feel right at home here and would definitely stay again! ,1
"We got our reservation last minute and Lisa was easy to communicate with.  Lisa has put much energy into providing everything and anything a guest might need including a private ""movie theater with popcorn.  She organized amenities (including many foods for breakfast!) to make things simple and streamlined.  She was friendly and warm and introduced us to their bearded dragon!",1
Excellent location. We really enjoyed the apartment. Perfect base for our 3 day visit. Clean and warm.,1
"The locaton was perfect, we where pretty much less than a mile from Boston Commons, The Prudential Center, Traders Joes, and Starbucks was a 3 min walk. Highly recommend B & G Oysters, and Stepanies short walk.",1
"Truly enjoyed our stay. Everything was well managed, clean and accommodating. Will definitely use your services again.",1
"I spent three days with my husband and my two teenagers in this appartment. This one was very pleasant, nothing was missing. The double bed is very confortable and the sofa is convertible. So 4 people can easily stay in the appartment. It is not far away from a subway station. There are some groceries and restaurants in the street. Seamless quickly answered my e-mails. Our stay was delightful.  I recommend this appartment.",1
"To start with, I have to say that the location is superb. Only a 7 minutes walk to Prudential centre, and lots of cafes and supermarkets nearby on Columbus Ave. We loved being in the centre of everything. 

But, the apartment is not in the best of conditions. The toilets were dated. The apartment wasn't even properly cleaned. There were dustballs in many places. And the sofa bed was extremely uncomfortable - the mattress was so thin you could feel the metal underneath. 

Also, there isn't an elevator in the building. If your apartment happens to be on the third floor, as ours were, you have to carry your luggage up several flights of very steep stairs. ",0
Great apartment in east boston. Clean and comfortable. Fully furnished apartment. Free street parking. Accommodating for dogs. Leah was quick to respond to issues/ questions regarding apartment. Nice deck and backyard to enjoy in warmer weather. In walking distance to convenience store and food. ,1
"The apartment in Boston was described as beautiful but that did not do it justice. Everything in the apartment was top notch both in the cleanliness of the apartment, the quality of the furnishings and all the amenities. We were there for the baseball game and the location of the apartment was so convenient to everything we needed to get to. Audrey and Andy were amazing hosts. We arrived late at night and left early in the morning but they went out of their way to fit with our schedules to get the keys and show us how everything worked. We had total privacy when we were there. We could not recommend Audrey's apartment highly enough and will definitely stay there again when we are in Boston.",1
"IT'S SUPER NICE APT!!!!!!!!
Location) It is super nice place. To travel in Boston, it's very close to the bus stop (#39, under 5 min to walk ) and subway(orange line, green line). I had a big luggage but it wasn't hard at all to come to this apt. 
Host) I asked Audrey to checkin earlier becuase I needed to move from another apt to this apt. Very kindly, she changed my checkin time after communicating with the guest checking out on that day. After checkin, I haven't seen her so it was very privacy. Also she gave me a list of nice restaurants and it really worked! and when I asked how to use hot water to Audery, she answered very fast with text message or e-mail. Nothing bothered me. I very appreciate Audrey and her husband.
Apt) It's surper nice. If I come back, I'll choose this apt again for sure. Everything is in the apt. In the kitchen, Microwave, refrigerator, coffe maker, clean spoon, knife, fork, dishes, bowl... So I could enjoy meal in the apt sometimes. In the bedroom, Nice bed!!! It's big enough to use for me and my friend. Closet was in it so I put my clothes on in. In the restroom, I could take a shower with hot water, also it was poosible to use washer. Wifi is working with good speed. And this apt is well interiored, so it would give perfect memory in Boston. 
THANKS, Audrey! ",1
"Audrey and Steven were fantastic hosts and made us welcome from key handover until we departed!  The apartment is beautifully decorated and has everything you need for a comfortable stay.  It is within a 5 min walk to Symphony Hall (and subway stop on the Green Line).  There are a number of shops, restaurants and coffee shops within a short walk of the apartment.  

Fenway Park is a comfortable 10-15 min walk from the apartment.   ",1
Great location. Great apartment. Host went out of their way to accommodate my late arrival.,1
Location was great the apartment was excellent between nicely furnished what went out anytime the unit is available the host and hostess easy to contact and very responsive wonderful weekend very nice people as well,1
Our stay at Audrey's place was amazing. The apartment was exactly as pictured and Audrey was very communicative. Arrival and departure was simple because Audrey was very accommodating. The location was wonderful and I enjoyed the safe neighborhood and easy walk to Fenway park. ,1
It was great staying at the apartment. It was better than what I have expected. Everything was very clean and comfortable. There was even a laundry unit within the apartment. We did a lot of cooking because everything you need is there. I had an amazing stay!!,1
"Exactly like the pictures with nice touches to make it feel like home.  The kitchen appliances are very nice and easy to use, and the bed is comfortable.  I really appreciated the desk in the bedroom for working, and the unit stayed comfortable no matter the outside weather.",1
"The apartment was just like the pictures in the profile.  Audrey and her husband were very nice and kept in touch to make sure everything was OK.  The street that the apartment is on was great, very quite, lots of trees, very close to everything you need.  Walking distance to the subway, just 2 blocks away, and Whole Foods, another 2 blocks.  

The apartment itself was very comfortable to stay in,  and we were very glad that they had Air Conditioning since it was pretty warm while we were in Boston.  We also felt very safe in the neighbourhood walking at night, and no issues with homeless people.  All in all the place was great, would recommend it to all my friends.

The only issue we had was that the comforter was too heavy for us.  Audrey took care of that right away and brought over a thinner one.  The hosts were great and we had no issues with them.",1
"Audrey was a wonderful host.  Check in was seamless.  The apartment was exactly as pictured and described.  Beautiful and updated. Location was ideal.  Within walking distance to many restaurants, etc.  Would definitely stay here again.",1
"Absolutely cute apartment in an absolutely cute neighborhood! Classic ""Boston"" atmosphere.  Several restaurants nearby and a corner grocery that saved us from starving after midnight:) Only a few blocks from a T station.  My husband and I used the T and walked everywhere.  Having a rental car in Boston would've been a nightmare.  Our hostess was very accommodating.  We arrived later than expected, and she met us promptly at the apartment to give us our key.  She was very accessible via text messages and email.  She was super helpful with anything we wanted to know.  My ONLY complaint about the apartment is that you only have about 10 minutes of hot water.  But my husband and I worked out a schedule and washed FAST.  But this was a VERY, VERY minor complaint.  Overall, I give this apartment and our hostess an A+++++++++!!! Would definitely stay again if we are in the area.  ",1
"How awesome !!! The apartment was exactly like the pictures. Very nice, very comfy, beautiful, nice smell... I can't imagine anything better that what Audrey did.

The neighbourhood is just awesome, walking distance from Fenway Park (Go Red Sox Go!), everything is very calm and quiet (I was afraid of the morning noise, as I am a night owl, but I slept like a baby and had to get up reluctantly from the awesome bed. 

The air conditioning was working perfectly, not too noisy (almost silent), the bathroom was spic and span and the kitchen also spotless.

Many MANY thanks for a great stay in Boston, in an awesome apartment in an awesome neighbourhood.",1
"Audrey is a very gracious host and met me at the appointed check in time. She is excellent in communicating beforehand and is easy to reach during the stay.

The apartment is beautifully decorated just like in the photos. The strong A/C was very welcome while visiting midsummer. There is a full kitchen for cooking or reheating. The location is very convenient if you're visiting Northeastern University, and is a short 10 minute walk to Bolyston, Newbury and the Prudential or Copley Square shopping centers. In the other direction, it's a 15 minute walk to Fenway Park or to Boston University. I'm looking forward to staying here in future visits to the city.",1
"My boyfriend and I stayed at Audrey's beautiful apartment for 2 nights. Needless to say, she was a perfect host, along with her husband Steven who greeted us to show us the apartment. We arrived  rather late from Paris and they patiently waited for us to get there. The apartment was absolutely perfect and cutely decorated, giving it a warm, cosy feel, exactly like in the pictures. The plus? It's on a wonderful, quaint, all-brick and typical Boston street lined up with lush trees. The apartment is very conveniently located, not far from Fenway and it's famous Red Sox games, Symphony Hall and the Prudential, boasting plenty of amenities around it (from Symphony market -open 24/7, to a Whole Foods just around the corner and a nice Pavement Cafe for morning coffee runs). Our experience was seamless and we couldn't have felt more at home. We miss it already :)",1
Audrey and Steven were great hosts. The apartment was very nice and perfectly compliant to the decription and the photos. Wonderful experience for me and my girlfriend,1
My girlfriend and I had a great experience with Christina! The place was in a great location and was very clean. She was always around if we had questions. Definitely a recommend in my books!,1
We had a wonderful stay in a very beautiful apartment. The location is ideal for all Boston has to offer and the apartment is really as wonderful as the pictures.  Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful. I would highly recommend Audry's home.,1
"Our stay was perfect.  The apt was exactly as described, very clean, fully renovated, like new.  Spacious, homey.  Had everything we needed.  The bed was very comfortable with great linens, although we are used to a king size so that took some getting used to. :-) Our host could not have been more responsive and dependable, waiting for us with keys and to help in any way she could even though we arrived in the evening.  Neighborhood & building very safe.  Short walk to subway stops.  Not a ton of restaurants in the immediate area (a few) but many a short distance away if you like to walk or take the subway.  Or a short cab ride or Uber.  Very central to everything.  We walked everywhere.  Loved our stay and hope to be back!",1
"The condo was so cute and exactly as advertised. Everything worked perfectly. You do need to wait 15-20 minutes between each shower for the water to get hot again, but once we planned for it, it was easy to get used to. Audrey was so helpful and answered every question we had very promptly. This location is in a beautiful brownstone neighborhood near Northeastern and is within walking distance to everything you might need. We were moving our son into his college dorm and had a lot of stuff, so the elevator was an added bonus. We loved this place, and would happily recommend it to anyone. We hope to stay here again when we're visiting Boston in the future!!!",1
The apartment is exactly as described.  We enjoyed our stay very much.  Location is awesome if your going to a game - as it is in within walking distance.  We also had purchased online tickets for a trolley tour and 2 pickup locations are within walking distance as well.   So for us it worked out beautifully.,1
Great place. Awesome location. Super clean. Easy and organized communication. Thanks!!,1
"We totally enjoyed our stay at this cozy, modern and well furnished apartment. Christina and Steven were terrific hosts, very flexible with our check-in and check-out schedule. Communication with Christina was easy and always in a timely manner. 

The neighborhood is very clean and safe, the location could not be better - walking distance to two metro stations, grocery stores and restaurants. The apartment is very clean and all the appliances work perfectly. We will definitely recommend this place to our friends and family.",1
"Great place. Exactly as described and photographed. Quiet and comfortable. Hosts are very welcoming, not intrusive, but makes sure that everything is going well with our stay. Very good communication. Street is tree lined and in a very quiet neighborhood. Parking could be challenging. 
I highly recommend her place and would stay here again when I'm in town. ",1
Amazing location!closed to the metro and to the main attractions. Very clean and complete of all the services pubblished. The host was always fast and available and she gave us interesting suggestions,1
"This is a great place to stay in Boston!  While it is located in an older building, the entire apartment has recently been renovated.  You can tell that great care was taken with the apartment--from the kitchen appliances to the bathroom tiling.  It is kept very clean.

We really enjoyed the central location of this apartment.  It was about a 10 minute walk for me to get to the Hynes Convention Center for a conference.  We enjoyed walking 5-6 minutes to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

We wouldn't hesitate to stay again!",1
"Our trip to Boston was absolutely wonderful, and this place played a huge role in that. The neighborhood is clean, safe, and conveniently located. We never worried when leaving or when returning. If we needed anything, there were shops, markets, and restaurants right around the corner. The apartment itself was impeccable. Very clean, spacious, and modern. There were nights we decided to just stay in and watch TV -- that's how comfortable and enjoyable the place is. Christina was amazing. She replied promptly and was so accommodating. We honestly could not have chosen a better place to stay.",1
We had a wonderful time in Boston - location was perfect for our visit at Northeastern.   The apartment was very nice and very comfortable.  The street was bustling with activity late at night - but that should be expected in a college town.  There was a little confusion on our end with which apartment we were staying in - but Stephen was able to quickly find us and get us back on track.    ,1
"Very lovely, clean, modern and comfy apartment, and well equipped. Short and cheap metro ride into central Boston or walkable if feeling fit. Samuel Adams brewery only 2 stops away (stony park), well worth a visit. Good recommendation from host for dinner was Giocomo's (14 min walk), great Italian food. 

Tip: if you have a late flight and want to explore Boston you can leave your luggage at Rowes Wharf Water Transport ($10 uber) after check out for a small fee, this worked out well for us as the water taxi goes to the airport.

Ps.If driving to the city beware as there are very limited street parking options in Boston as a whole, and car parks are quite expensive ($30 a day). This is not specific to this apt, but a general observation!",1
Stephen was most helpful in guiding us to the apt from the train station and we had no problem finding it.  He was most helpful and prompt to answer any texts.,1
Our stay in Boston was great - mostly in part to the wonderful hosts and this lovely apartment! The hosts had great communication when we landed and were able to meet us right away. The apartment is just as cute as the photos and everything was very clean. There were lots of amenities as well (including a hair dryer that my girlfriend appreciated). We had some sight seeing questions that the hosts answered right away. We would definitely come back and recommend to anyone who stays in Boston!,1
"I have had a very good experience this time. 
The apartment is great (as good as it looks in the pictures), very clean and well equipped, the hosts are responsive and accommodating, without being intrusive. 
I would definitely stay here again.",1
"I really enjoyed my stay at Cristina's flat.  It's in a great location with a quiet neighborhood and within walking distance of shops, restaurants and the convention center where I was attending a conference.  The apartment was bright, clean, and tastefully appointed with modern furniture and stainless appliances that worked flawlessly.  I appreciated the fast wifi and cable TV.

Christina was a great host, and flexible when meeting me when I had a late flight.  She was also very responsive and helpful when I locked myself out and she came to let me in (thanks, Christina!).

It's a classy place and a bargain compared to nearby hotels.  Recommended.",1
"What a fantastic stay at Christina's lovely apartment in Boston! The apartment is comfortably furnished and gets a lot of sunlight, which is something I always appreciate when away from home. It's located in a very convenient part of the city, and, since weather was so wonderful while I was in town, I took full advantage and walked everywhere. Almost everything I needed was in walk distance -- Trader Joe's, the archives at Boston University, cute cafes -- and for everything else, the Orange and Green lines were easy to catch. The building itself is also very quiet, and while there was a little bit of noise outside during the weekend due to college students walking by, I fully expected that and wasn't bothered; it's no more than what you would expect when you're in a major city. 

Christina and Steven were fantastic hosts; they knew I had luggage with me so arranged to let me check in a bit earlier and check out a bit later as well. They also checked in with me partway through my six day stay to make sure everything was going well and to see if they could be of help in any way.

Overall, I had a great time and would happily return should I find myself in Boston again. Thank you, Christina and Steven!",1
"We had a really nice stay at Christina's place. The apartment was very clean and organized and had everything we needed to feel at home over the holidays. They thought about the small details, like umbrellas in the closet and laundry detergent which was much appreciated.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in a convenient location. Christina and Steven were also always responsive on email and during check in. ",1
Wonderful; beautiful. Gorgeous apartment in a convenient and quiet location. ,1
"The apartment is just like the photos; bright, airy, spacious, comfortable and very close to Northeastern, Wholefoods, T, restaurants........

We had a lovely 10 day stay and we had everything we needed. The hosts were great - even when I thought I'd lost the key.

Hope to stay on a future visit.",1
This house is comfortable and convenient! Highly recommended! Will stay if come to Boston again! ,1
Everything was a home run. The location is great. Only half a mile to Fenway and about the same distance to Boylston Street. Host was there to greet me as soon as I arrived. They were accommodating to any request I would have.,1
"Amazing place in Boston!! Fresh, super clean and really comfortable! Christina and Steven were really welcoming too.

I recommand this place and I can't wait to go back here in Boston!

Charlotte. ",1
"Christina and her husband were extremely welcoming hosts, even taking their time to check-in face to face. Other then the shower problem (the second person couldn't get hot water even after waiting for 30min), the place was just as described in the pictures, and I especially appreciated the shoes-free environment. The location is convenient only several minutes away from symphony station. Recommended! ",1
"The apartment was convenient, comfortable, clean and smartly decorated. The kitchen was well equipped and essential supplies were all there - including coffee. Christina's communication and check-in were perfect.",1
"We had a wonderful time at Christina's apartment. It was comfy and clean. It is in a great part of Boston particularly if you need to be near Northeastern, Fenway, BU Prudential Center. You can even walk to Beacon Hill and the T stop is very close. Highly recommend this location and this apartment. It's in a great neighborhood. ",1
"Christina and Steven's apartment is large and sunny, and very comfortable, near all major T-lines, and within walking distance of down town Boston. Steven met us with the keys when we arrived, but we did not see either of them again during our visit, although they did check in with us by email to see how we were going.   Unfortunately, unlike pre us raiders, we did not find the apartment to be very clean.  The fridge contained several portions of unfinished take away food and drink, and the fridge itself was in need of a good clean.  The dishwasher had not been run since the previous guests left and there were dirty glasses put away in the cupboard.  We threw away food and dealt with the dishes, but were disappointed to have to do that soon after our arrival.  Otherwise it was a great spot to stay.",0
"Communication between ourselves and Christina was excellent and we were met at, and shown around, the apartment. Living space very nice, clean and fresh, and well maintained. The apartment is situated in a quiet street yet very close to all amenities. We enjoyed our stay there and would recommend it to other potential travellers to Boston.  
",1
Very clean and well kept apartment in a great location!,1
"Upon arriving to the location Steven made us feel extremely welcome. He helped us with our luggage, and even gave us tips on what to do in the area. The listing description was exactly the way it was advertised. We loved the décor and felt it was very homey, and extremely cozy. The location of the listing was great. It was a cute, quiet neighborhood area that we really enjoyed. There were many different nearby markets/shops that were just a walk away. We loved the area and would definitely recommend it to others.
",1
"  Christina and Steven are great hosts. The apartment is clean and cozy in a great location, near all major T-lines. We spent a great time the apartment, just like at home. When we arrived, Steven was waiting for us with keys. We did not see either of them again during our whole visit, but they connect with us through text at the end. This apt is really a great place to stay. 
",1
"Clean, small, and cozy apartment. Emily is the most responsive host I've ever encountered! Would definitely stay again if it could just be a little bit cheaper",1
"Emily was a great host and the apartment was just as advertised.  Incredible location.  Could walk everywhere.  Clean and mostly comfortable.  We did have a little trouble sleeping.  The mattress is especially hard and because the winds were up, branches continuously scraped against the bedroom window.  It's also worth noting that there isn't a lot of hot water capacity, so showers have to be spaced out so the water can replenish.   Finally, there's nowhere to leave a key so it required coordination (i.e. many texts) to meet up to get keys.  Despite all this, I'd still recommend Emily's place.  Just a few things that travelers should be aware of.  ",0
It was really easy to meet up with Steven to get the key and a tour of the apartment. The apartment was great and perfect for our needs. It was in a great neighborhood and so close to the T. We used public transportation the whole time. Definitely recommend for anyone visiting Boston! ,1
"It was a great opportunity and experience for us to stay here. We enjoyed our stay very much. The apartment was very clean, the bed very comfortable and the hot water plentiful.That is very happy.
",1
"The host was there at the door ready to let us in, was in contact with us at all times and made sure that we were able to get to and from our parking to the location we were interested in. Additionally, we were able to get recommendations on what to do and where to go based on them and helped us move in. Seriously awesome people.",1
"We enjoyed our stay very much. The apartment was very clean, the bed very comfortable and the hot water plentiful. There were all of the creature comforts that two people would need. All in a great location. Two thumbs up!",1
"The apartment was great., very clean and spacious.  The neighborhood was awesome.  The owners, were very helpful.",1
"Me and my partner stayed in Boston at Emily's place for 3 nights, and we liked it a lot! The apartment is beautiful, nicely decorated, convenient, and well equipped (kitchen, laundry machine). It was also very clean when we got there, and the location was great! We met Christina to give us the keys and show us around, and she was extremely nice and welcoming. Thanks Christina for the hospitality!  ",1
"The host was very welcoming and accommodating.  She was very responsive and checked on me during my stay.  The listing was in a nice, safe, quiet neighborhood and the apartment was very clean.",1
"The place was great!  Very clean and modern.  In a great neighborhood with shops and places to eat nearby.  Emily was very accommodating to us.
Parking was the only draw back.  Since we were only there for 2 nights we parked in the public lot at the end of the block.  Our car was safe there and we didn't have to worry about getting ticketed or towed.
I would stay there again!",1
"I have to say that this is one of the best airbnb I ever stayed.  The hosts are extremely friendly, and know Boston very well.  The apt is super clean and cozy.  The location cannot be beat, it is on a quite street and close to transportation and other point of interests.  Me and my girl friend definitely enjoyed our stay, Thanks Emily!",1
"This is a wonderful place to stay.  The condo is very clean and comfortable.  The street is a quiet residential street, in a neighborhood that has many university students (but not rowdy students at all).  The building is located close to shopping, restaurants, and tourist attractions.  The owner, Christina and her husband are wonderful hosts.  We could not have asked for anything more from them -- they were attentive to our needs, offering to help throughout our 10 day stay.  We will definitely return to this condo.  Everything was just as described on the AirbnB listing.  Thank you both for such a wonderful stay!  Until next time!",1
"The apartment is very nice and clean. The location is very convenient, ~2 minute walk away from the Symphony T station. There are also lots of stores and restaurants nearby. Emily and Steve are very kind hosts. I would definitely stay here again. ",1
"This was a wonderful place to stay! It was so comfortable and close to transit, shopping and museums. We loved the neighborhood and look forward to staying again on our next trip to Boston!",1
Staying with Emily was a wonderful experience starting with our very late arrival.  She checked in with us to make sure everything was going well and offered advice anything we might need.  The location can't be beat and her efforts to be an exceptional host made our stay perfect.  ,1
I can only second all the positive reviews for this apartment. Great apartment in a great area with a great host. I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough. The whole experience was excellent.,1
Emily our host was wonderful and everything was as pictured. Neighborhood was safe.  It was perfect location and apartment was very clean and was very homey.  Wish we could have had more time to enjoy it.,1
Great location- amazing) very clean and comfortable apartment) walking distance to museums ) Emyli is very pretty and took care of us) thank you so much) great great location!!!!! ,1
"This apartment was just as advertised. It was very comfortable, clean and convenient.  The bed is a double bed (not sure if that was in the listing ) but it was just fine.   We enjoyed our stay very much and would recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area. ",1
"This was a great stay for us! The apartment is perfect, just as described, and the location couldn't be any better. Met up with the hosts seamlessly to get keys and discuss how to get around a little bit. Great communication, great stay. Would definitely stay again when returning to the area.",1
Perfect hosts. Perfect location. We couldn't have felt more comfortable and were well looked after. Totally understand now why this apartment is so rarely available as we had a lovely experience. Thank you so much! Hope to visit Boston and you again in the future. ,1
Very friendly and helpful with local restaurants,1
Emmily was very welcoming and we feel like living in our own home. The apartment is very confortable and has all amenities. The location is perfect for travelers that want to be near what is best in Boston.,1
Very comfortable apartment in a quiet neighborhood. Easy walking distance to Fenway and Back Bay area. Emily and Steven made the check-in very simple and checked back with me the next day to be sure everything was in order. Will definitely stay here again! ,1
"We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is clean and cozy,and it nears Northeastern University. Emily and her husband are always helpful,they often text us to ask what we need. It's my best Airbnb experience!I will stay here if I come to Boston again.",1
"We visited Boston with my wife and my parents in law and had a great time at this apartment. The location is convenient and cool, even at moments where the Red Sox fans were swarming the streets. The apartment was great in every sense: comfortable, intimate, spacious and well equipped. Despite our last-minute request, Seamless replied very fast, and was flawless in securing our stay. The only downside was the internet connection, which was incredibly slow. Overall, we had a great time in this great place and would surely recommend it to anyone.",0
"While others have had great experiences with Seamless, ours was unfortunately not a good one.

We booked a different apartment, but were informed the day before move in that the original apartment had a plumbing problem so we were moved into this one. But that was only after I called to ask why we didn't have move in instructions yet (I'd sent 3 emails asking where the move in instructions were with no reply).  

This apartment had had a long term renter in it that moved out the day before we arrived.  Seamless' cleaning crew worked on it all day and when we arrived it appeared clean on the surface, so we moved in.  Once we were in though we started to see just how dirty it was.  Filthy.  Old food stuck in the kitchen, food stuck in the kitchen sink, sticky spots on the floor, dirty furniture, dirty carpet.  On top of being dirty there was a burned out light bulb in the bathroom, one of the bathroom sinks didn't drain, one of the window blinds fell off when we opened it, the carbon monoxide detector chirped constantly, the elevator was broken (making a loud noise) keeping us up at night (they fixed that on day 3 of our stay). We wanted to move, but it was such a pain we decided to live with it.

I emailed Seamless 3 times while we were in the apartment about the filth and the issues with the apartment and never received a reply.  That's 6 total emails to them without a reply.  I would never rent from them again.

"The apartment was very nice, clean, and in a great location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay. ",1
If you like a quiet and friendly place to stay I strongly recommend Julie and Lou's place. I good place to rest and relax. I really enjoyed to be there!,1
"The studio was exactly as described and shown in the pictures.  It was very clean, neat, organized and in a great location.  The building was easy to get into with the help of the host and the location is in a quiet street and just steps away from the green T, whole foods, restaurants and other locations.   
Even though the host was not around, he was very easily approachable via phone to answer any questions/comments.  He is very nice and very helpful.    I would extremely recommend this place to anyone visiting Boston, and I'll definitely come back! ",1
"Great stay - apartment very attractive and clean. Perfect location: very nice neighborhood, quiet street, easy access to T and short walk to BU campus. Dylan was very accommodating and accessible. Would definitely stay here again. ",1
"I had a woderful two-months stay at Dylan's apartment. It's exactly as described, very clean and the bed is super comfortable. The location is awesome, very quiet and close to the T station.
I had to contact Dylan a very few times because everything was perfect and he has always been reliable and replied very quickly.
I would definitely recommend this apartment and I wish I could stay there again in my next trip to Boston.",1
"Dylan made the experience of staying at this apartment great! Awesome to deal with, great location, clean. A little on the cozy side, but super convenient to public transportation in a really safe neighbourhood! Can hear a tiny bit of noise of people coming in and out as apartment is near building entrance.",1
Great studio in wonderful location. Dylan was very responsive and helpful. ,1
"Great value! Perfect size for 2 people (like a medium size hotel room), great price, nice amenities, amazing location. Cleanliness is a large part of how I rate my experience, and the unit was spotless. Dylan hires someone to clean after his guests leave, and they do a great job. 

NOT for people who:
- like soft beds
- are against veloured towels
- can't sleep with bird or other noises (heavy door that slams when people enter the building) 
- want to meet the owner

PERFECT for people who:
- need to take the T (green line, St. Mary's stop) 
- want to be perfectly in the middle of downtown Boston and other areas (Coolidge for example)
- want an easy check in and check out 
- love the appeal of brownstones 

We had a great stay and would thoroughly recommend this Airbnb! ",1
"The apartment is on a quiet, gorgeous side street but it's only about a block away from the T. The apartment is beautiful, with tons of natural light and comfortable furniture. Dylan was a great host. He made sure we arrived safely and checked in along the way.",1
"This spot has a perfect location as it's nestled in a quiet neighborhood yet only a 3 min walk to the St Mary's Green Line C stop. The space was incredibly nice and neat. Ideal for a couple or individual. The kitchenette was perfect for medium cooking as it has a stove, refrigerator and has cleaning supplies to cleanup after! The bathroom has a bath/shower, mirrored medicine cabinet with premium bath products from Whole Foods. The bed is quite firm (maybe a pillow top mattress cover would be worth considering), but the pillows and bedding are nice. As summer visitors, the AC was incredible. Overall, I give this place a 9/10 due to quality of the space, convenience of location and constant communication with Dylan. Dylan is a great host! Thanks again and we hope to come back next year! ",1
This was a great place to stay near Fenway!  Very comfortable and easy to contact Dylan with questions.  So close to the train and essentials.  Thank you for hosting us!,1
"Excellent space in a great location. Quiet side street off of Beacon. Quick and convenient access to the T. 15-20 minutes and you're downtown. Host was quick and accommodating to all inquiries. Allowed us to stay a little later after checkout because our flight was later in the afternoon. 

Overall a great experience and I would recommend to anyone. ",1
The neighborhood was in a very safe area of Boston. Dylan was very easy to communicate with and made directions extremely easy to understand. He was a great host and this was the perfect location while also having all of the amenities we needed. ,1
Had a great experience.  Location was incredible-convenient walk to Fenway Park and to public transportation.  Highly recommend!,1
"I enjoyed my stay at Ricardo's. His visiting nephew met me when I arrived and was a wonderful host as well. I enjoyed the laid back atmosphere and access to the whole house. I ate some meals on the back porch, which was overlooking the yard. It was also a nice, quiet neighborhood with easy on-street parking. I would recommend Ricardo's place!",1
"This place looks exactly like its pictures. I liked the neighborhood as it was only about 20 min subway/metro to downtown boston and much affordable compared to the downtown core. There is a short walk from the subway station (~5-10 min). Also to mention that this place can accommodate 5-6 ppl. The kitchen very clean and lots of stuff were brand new.
On the other side, Perry is very responsive, there were times that I had messaged him and he responds very fast and does everything he can to help you to have a pleasant stay.

Great Stay, Thanks Perry!
",1
"The place was fantastic! New, remodeled, clean, spacious , and convenient to T-line transport (5 block walk). Perry was accessible and responded to questions and solved problems promptly. There wasn't any ""problems"" - just a slight misunderstanding with the brand new entry remote entry system that Perry had just installed 
Again - highly recommended - this was our first Air experience and will definitely do it again ! ",1
"We had a great stay with our 2 dogs! The house was as described, and Perry was very helpful :)",1
good hourseholder,1
"We had a great stay at Perry's Egleston Sq/JP apartment! The place feels new with high ceilings and a great kitchen. Overall, we felt very welcome. 

Perry was also very responsive. He checked with us a few times before our stay, and we mentioned that we were traveling with our toddler. He arranged for a crib to be set up and for a high chair to be ready in the kitchen. When we arrived, we found that the cleaning crew hadn't cleaned the high chair. We informed Perry and he immediately dropped by to take the chair to be cleaned. Not 30 minutes later, he returned with a spotless chair!

We were also concerned because our toddler is now getting mischievous and we forgot to pack our outlet covers. Again, we asked Perry if he had any extra, and he delivered quickly, yet again! 5-star service for sure!

I'm not sure when we'll be back in Boston again. But whenever we are, we'll check with Perry. And we'll be sure to refer any friends traveling to Boston to check out Perry's wonderful apartment!",1
"My son, his wife and baby twin girls stayed at Perry's apartment over the long Thanksgiving weekend.  It was a perfect place for them to stay.  A crib, stroller, kid's eating chair, changing table.  It was clean and comfortable--good for the toddlers and adults alike.

A walk away from the subway and parks and very close to my house.  I'd totally recommend this apartment.",1
"We stayed here for almost 2 months when we relocated to Boston quite quickly.  The apartment was very clean and very new. Perry went out of his way on multiple occasions to make sure that me, my husband and our 18 month old son had everything we needed.

The kitchen and bathroom are very newly renovated and the kitchen had everything we needed (appliances, pots/pans, etc).

We had a great experience here and would definitely recommend it.",1
"We had a great stay and Perry was an exceptional host.  He made us feel right at home and was extremely accommodating which is so important when traveling with a toddler.  Perry was even able to provide a crib, high chair and passes to museums that helped keep us out of the cold.  The apartment is extremely spacious and has all the amenities needed with a really comfy and well equipped kitchen.  will definitely visit again.  Thanks for the stay Perry!",1
"The place exceeded all of my expectations.  Amazing trip. My kids and I felt very welcomed from the time we got there until the day we left.  Very close to the orange line which gets you everywhere.  Perry was a fantastic host and even got us some free passes to the science museum.  A trip worth doing again and I would for sure stay at one of Perry's places.
Everything was exactly as it was described and more.  The place was very clean and we lacked of nothing.  Great host and great place.",1
"My friends and I had a great stay at Perry's place in Jamaica Plains. Perry was very gracious in offering us this place when another rental was already taken (for the same price). We were very happy with this apartment which was clean, spacious, and had plenty of bedding for us all. Perry was readily available for any concerns and questions. Unfortunately, our free aquarium passes were unavailable, but Perry very kindly reimbursed us for the tickets that we paid for! We could not have asked for more satisfying service! A very accommodating host, a comfortable, secure and warm space, and easy access to the stony brook T subway station, this AirBnB is highly recommended by us all.",1
"This space was exactly as described.  Perry was very responsive to all of our emails and questions, and went so far as to dig up some spare coats for our son who forgot to pack his!  I would be happy to stay at this apartment again.",1
"Perry was a lovely host.  The apartment was very comfortable.  Everything was newly renovated and as described.  The kitchen is especially nice and we appreciated that the place is well set up for a young child, including high chair and crib.  The off-street parking is appreciated on Mondays when the street cleaners tow away the unwary.  Perry and family live upstairs and are easy to talk to and helpful.",1
The apartment was exactly as described. It was clean and spacious. Perry was a good host and responded quickly to any questions. ,1
"Perry's house is much cleaner and bigger than it is in the pictures. We are very happy to stay at his apartment. 
Perry is also very friendly and thoughtful. He explained all the instructions very clearly and he kept contacting us to know if we had any question.
The house is located in a nice neighborhood, about 5 minute walking to a train/subway station.",1
The home was very clean and centrally located for us.  ,1
"we all agreed- this is wonderful and convenient place to stay! thank you, Perry!!",1
Perry was a wonderful host (familiar with the area and had great suggestions for things to do).  The accommodations were luxurious and pristine.  Highly recommend!,1
"111 School St. was the perfect spot for a week-long family reunion with our son and his girlfriend (who live in JP).  The flat itself is very comfortable, spacious, spotless, and well-equipped;  the lovely kitchen made meal prep easy and the AC was very welcome in the hottest week of the summer.  Perry is a super host:  full of great info, thoughtful (he even took our dog for a walk!), and fun. We were inspired by the diversity and vernacular architecture of the JP community and found lots within walking distance to keep us busy (Sam Adams tour, Franklin Park, Doyle's, lots of restaurants, the Arnold Arboretum).  But also downtown Boston is an easy T-ride, hiking in the Blue Hills is a 30-minute drive, and Cape beaches are only an hour away.  Obviously we need to come back if you'll have us!",1
"George was a great host and even gave advice on the best way to get in from the Airport. The apartment is beautiful I spent most of the time at the table in the corner working on my computer staring out at the waterfront. Plenty of shops, restaurants and transportation options near by. Very clean room with a nice private bath.",1
"This place was great and George was the best . the best location , right across from the beautiful waterfront. The airport is a few minutes away,shops are within walking distance and the place is right above one of Boston's finest restaurants . the room is really nice and clean and so is the bathroom and the rest of the apartment. George was super nice , I felt like I was with one of my buds I've known a long time . great place . great host . five stars !!!!",1
"This couldn't have worked out more perfectly.  We had a wedding to attend at the Boston Exchange Conference Center, which turned out to be right across the street from George's place!  The view is spectacular and George was very welcoming, and very flexible with arrival and departure times.  Would definitely stay again!",1
Great apartment. Great location. Great host. Highly recommended. ,1
"I had a great stay at George's place! George is a very thoughtful, helpful and friendly Host; his apartment is tastefully decorated, very comfy and clean, and the view is amazing! I highly recommend :)",1
"The apartment is in the prime location if you are attending a conference in BCEC. Beautiful night view, safe environment, clean and comfy bed, and good wifi and TV cable as well. Definitely recommended for any conference attendee",1
"Beautiful view, and excellent accommodations!  The host is very considerate and helpful.  I would stay here again.",1
George was a wonderful host. I arrived in Boston for business and was very impressed by the immaculate apartment I was welcomed by. The view was wonderful and apartment was spotless. I would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Boston.,1
"I felt welcome and the neighborhood is newly built.  Restaurants all around, easy to get to the airport on the Silver Line bus which is free.",1
"What a great place! The view is amazing, the room is great, and the location was perfect for my trip. Everything you need. George is a really nice guy and helpful. Every year, I spend a few days in Boston before heading to Provincetown. The place is great if you're taking the Bay State Cruise, it's practically across the street. You don't have to go far for restaurants either, they're all downstairs in the building and you'll find more across the street. I will be staying here again.",1
This is Seaport living at it's best and a great value.There is a million dollar view in the apartment and this apartment is right across the street from the best restaurants in the Seaport area in Boston.If you don't know the Seaport is a hot spot in Boston right now.Apartment was very clean and host was very fast to communicate. ,1
"We had a wonderful time in Boston, thanks also to the very cosy apartment with a splendid view of water and boats, beautiful indeed.

George is a very good host, no doubt about that.

Hope to come back sometime.

"If you're looking for a quite and comfortable place to stay in Boston,
I highly recommend this one. Great variety of restaurants right across the street and around but my favorite was the No Name Restaurant right in front at the Fish Pier (seafood). Really close to South Station to go around the city or even out state in train. Quiet neighborhood. Excellent view from the apartment as the pics describes it but even better the terrace at 9th floor. Beautiful city!!!",1
George was great.  Greeted me in the lobby to give me a key and gave me a tour of the place.  Beautiful place with an awesome view of the water.  Would definitely stay there again.,1
Great apartment with an amazing view! Spotless modern bathroom and really comfortable sheets/bed. Felt very private even though we shared the apartment. Perfect location if you're taking the ferry to Provincetown. Lots of restaurants to choose from. I would highly recommend George's place!,1
George was great and accommodating. Easy in and easy out. I came in for a business trip and he made sure I was take care of. Loved the space and the view and of course the location. Super close to my work event which was very convenient. ,1
"George was fantastic! I am a first time AirBnB user and he made the whole process very smooth. Upon my arrival, he left the keys with the front desk. He was in constant communication with me. The room was clean, the apartment smelled great, and the view was amazing! He lives in a very central location of Boston and everything is nearby. I had a 10K on my last day and George was very flexible with my check out time. Overall, 5+ stars for George. Highly recommended! I can't wait to come back. ",1
"I can only echo what everyone else has said, George was a great host and the apartment is clean and has a beautiful view.  We were only in Boston for a short time before flying out from Logan early the next morning.  The location is great for getting to the airport - 10 minutes by Taxi and a few minutes more if you walk to the Silver line.

",1
"The room was great and exceeded my expectations. The picture hardly does justice to the actual views. Super clean, easy check in and check out. I was especially impressed by the bathroom amenities: toothpaste, mouthwash, soaps, etc. The location is great, right near many great restaurants and only 2 blocks from where I was working. I highly recommend George's place. And George was a great host, never got to meet him in person, but he was very responsive when I needed anything. Everything went smoothly. Plus, when hotels in that area are going for more than double the price, this place is a no brainer!",1
"George was very welcoming and accommodating. The apartment is beautiful, and is located in a focal area. My husband attended a career fair at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center, to which this apartment is very close to (5 minutes walking distance). 

The view is amazing, and if you like sunrises, then this is the place to be. 

The room and bathroom were very clean and nice toiletries were also provided. 

Overall, George was very friendly and we definitely recommend you to stay in his place! You won't regret it!

Thank you George.

George was very welcoming and a great host! The apartment was beautiful and in a great location with amazing views of the waterfront. The room and bathroom were very clean and well maintained and provided with everything we needed. George was very accommodating and quick to respond to text and emails with any questions we had. Overall a great experience and I would definitely recommend to anyone planning to visit the Boston area!,1
"George was friendly, the view was beautiful, and his place was clean and very close to the convention center. Thanks again!",1
"Great place, great host. The views of the Boston harbor were worth the stay on their own, and on top of that George kept a clean apt and helped make the stay easy",1
"Great communication from start to finish - even though we never actually met. George's place is nice, super-clean and in a great location, near the Silver Line. The bed is a pull-out daybed, nice and large. Not the ultimate comfort mattress, but not bad...and in this neighborhood, where you can't touch a hotel room for less than $350+, it's a tiny inconvenience for an overall sweet place to stay. Thanks for being a great host, George!",1
"Lovely neighbourhood, great appartment. Cousy, very well kept and outstanding view. George was super helpful and we didn't even notice him there. Comes with access to a great gym, also very cool.",1
"George was very efficient and available to me although I had few needs beyond check-in which was smooth and quick. The room was clean. The views were as described. The neighbourhood felt safe. I stayed 3 nights, each night I returned after dark. ever once felt threatened  The location was good. Close to public transportation. The stay was better than expected.",1
Great building in a convenient location with paid parking underneath if you need it.  George made things easy and was very communicative in order to get the key.   The apartment has a great view and is really quiet.  It's set up well for a convenient rental.       Overall I had a very good experience that worked out well for my conference.  ,1
"The apartment is beautiful, clean and quiet.  It's about 5 min's walk to the boston world trade center and seaport hotel. You can see the beautiful seaport view through the window. There are plenty of restaurants and a nice grocery store downstairs. If you like seafoods and lobster, you can buy them at the Yankee  lobster, they are live and fresh.  And the transportation is very convenient , the silver line is close which transfer from the airport to the south station. There is a kitchen with all utensils where you can cook as you like. The bathroom is clean and provide towels ,toothpaste and bath supplies. The host  George is a very nice and considerate gentleman.  I strongly recommend this apartment and I think I will be back next time if I visit Boston again.",1
The place was perfect. The location was terrific. George was helpful too. It is worth the amount - you are connected to the public transport - in walking distance of entire downtown Boston. The room is a little small with two beds - but then that's fine. You are probably going to be out most of the day anyway!,1
"A wonderful place to stay, very close to the convention center and boston world trade center. The room is confortable with a private bathroom just across the hall. There are 2 single beds that can be put together to make a double bed. The mattresses are confortable but a bit too soft for my friend's injured back.
George is great host and I couldn't even notice his presence in the apartment. He made sure we had everything to make us feel at home. I definitely recomend staying there!
Um lugar maravilhoso para ficar, muito perto do centro de convenções e do boston world trade center. O quarto é confortável, com um banheiro privado logo do outro lado do corredor. Tem 2 camas de solteiro que podem ser colocadas juntas para formar uma cama de casal. Os colchões são confortáveis, mas um pouco moles demais para as costas da minha amiga. O George é um ótimo anfitrião e eu nem podia notar sua presença no apartamento. Ele fez de tudo para nos sentirmos em casa. Eu com certeza recomendo a hospedagem!",1
The place is beautiful and very well located. Close enough from the airport taking the silver line and walking distance if you like to walk to downtown Boston. Very clean and comfortable. George was a great host always responding fast when we had any questions. He even provided us with shampoo and other supplies for the bathroom. We are coming back again for sure!,1
"The apartment is great and looks like on George description skyline view include. Nice and Clean everywhere. We met George on our arrival But we were in Touch sinceramente we made The booking, he is Very understanding and available , we recommend for sure to our friend and in case we'll come Back To Boston we'd love to stay again there.

Great location close to the convention center. George was very welcoming and ensured that my stay was pleasant. ,1
"Great great location and accommodations, George was very responsive to all concerns.",1
"Just as the title says: Beautiful Waterfront Location - and when I stayed Boston put on some nice weather so I could appreciate it. The place was great, as in the pictures - very nice bathroom, well appointed and George goes the extra mile providing amenities. The location was excellent for me as I had a conference near by - but it is also a 15 minute walk from down town. 
There is a concierge and a gym, so you kind of feel like you are in a hotel. George was communicative and accommodating, I would highly recommend it.",1
"This is a great apartment with such a beautiful ocean view. The room was clean and amenities were in a very good condition. It is very convenient to have a private bathroom right in front of the bedroom, so you never need to bother the host (George) who lives in the master bedroom -- I actually could not have any chance to encounter him at all during my 4-day stay. However, George is very kind to take care of guests via emails and/or text messages. In addition, one of the best part of this apartment is the location -- right next to a lot of hotels and conference centers. 

I fully enjoyed my stay at this beautiful waterfront apartment. Thanks George!",1
"Clean, close to where I needed to be, more amenities than I normally see at an Airbnb listing. Great host as well!",1
This was a terrific place to stay. Five minute walk from my conference at the convention center. Several good restaurant choices in the few blocks around the building. Convenient parking on the building too. George was easy to deal with and in close touch. Apartment is great and well-appointed with a terrific view. Highly recommend in every respect. ,1
"George was very prompt on his reply to my messages. 

I actually didn't know that George was living on the same apartment but it was cool.  George is a very nice guy. We talked for a while but he had to leave right away to catch a flight. 

Checking in and out was very fast.  He told me to take the free bus ride from airport to the city. The bus ride took about 10 minutes and from the bus station, I just walked about 5 minutes to the apartment.

 The apartment was very clean and the room has a very nice view of fish port and sea. Lots of restaurants around and a nearby grocery and Convenience store too. 

Wifi has very strong signal whether inside the room or the living room. It was so nice to work on the living room because of the great view. 

What you see in the pictures are accurate. The bed was very comfortable and both the room and living room have cable tv.  

The washroom was very clean. One thing I must tell George is to replace his bath towel. The one I used had a big hole. But I am a guy so it wasn't a big issue.. BUT if his guest was a female, might be an issue.

I also received a nice gift from George on my second night. He left a gift certificate on the table from one of the restaurants that he manages. Thank you so much for the nice gesture. I enjoyed my dinner.

The residents living in this apartment were very nice and courteous. This is a pleasant surprise to me.

I will surely visit Boston again because of the seafood show. I will definitely stay in this apartment again if available.

"What a fantastic apartment, location and view! Highly recommend this Airbnb -- book it if you can. I arrived for a conference and took the Silver Line for free from the airport to the first stop (Boston World Trade Center), and the apartment was a 5 minute walk away. Beautiful view from the bedroom, living room and 9th floor roof deck. George is great about communicating and pretty much gives you a lot of space at the apartment. You have access to a private gym a block away. I'd come back here in a hearbeat.",1
"Had a great time at this apartment - nice location, friendly host (who we barely saw, but was there when we needed him) and a good space to make our base of operations for our visit to Boston. Would definitely use again.",1
"George has a clean, beautiful condo. He communicated with me very well before and during my stay so I felt easy and comfortable during my stay. Five star rating for him!",1
Perfect location if attending a conference in Boston. Everything went very smooth thanks to George.,1
"I had a great stay at George's place while in town for a conference. It is very convenient to get to the Westin conference center, and there are restaurants nearby. The views of the water and boats are awesome. George was very accommodating, prompt with communication, and he checked in once or twice to see if I needed anything. I had the place mostly to myself, which was a bonus.

"George was very easy to communicate with. His apartment is very beautiful and was extremely clean and convenient. It was a perfect spot for our one night stay in Boston. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spaceous and clean. It is also close to some cool locations such as the brewery Trillium, and the restaurant Row 34.",1
Great spot with an awesome view!  George accommodated my very early arrival which was awesome after my overnight flight from the west coast.  My afternoon nap was heavenly in the very comfy bed!  I'd definitely stay again.,1
Location is excellent and the views are incredible. Very modern and super clean! Fully equipped.,1
"The room is literally a stone's throw from the water with absolutely no noise from the Airport.  Surrounded by restaurants and 2 Starbucks.  I purchased the 7-Day Link pass for $19 and used the Silver Line (2 min walk) and Subway to get to Commons (10-12min) and Prudential Center (15-20min).

George kept a very good communication and promptly replied to all of my requests.  I stayed 3 nights and never saw him.  I enjoyed my first AirBnB stay and would not hesitate to go back to George's  place. ",1
"The place is in a super great location, next to amazing restaurants, a lot of tourist locations, perfect for people staying in the area or going to a convention. It was also extremely clean. George puts a lot of care into the place, puts out amenities, and you feel right at home. You never notice George, and if you do get a chance to run into him he's actually a super good guy! Great view, great place overall.",1
"I had a very comfortable stay at George's place. Location was so convenient and close to the convention center. View is nice both day and night and rooms are super clean. George was so nice and asked me if everything was ok. It was my first Airbnb and I felt it's more comfortable than staying in a hotel. Thank you so much, George!",1
Lovely condo with a beautiful view. I love the location and the condo was neat and clean and welcoming. Would I stay there again? Absolutely. In a heartbeat.,1
"The apartment is exactly as described and the view is what you see from the front window.  Full kitchen, great views, great location. Keurig was put out both regular & decaf. Across the street from all the best restaurants and 5 minute walk to the BCEC, which is why I was there.  Definitely recommend.",1
George's home is so clean and nice. There is a beautiful seaview of the dining room. His home is so easy to get anywhere which are interesting places to visit. There are enough kitchenware can be used to cook simple meal. George is a very good host who is been trying his best to make us better. He is a nice person who is easy to communicate with. We have wonderful days at his home. ,1
"Great apartment, great location. George was very accommodating and did everything he could to make me feel at home even for a night.",1
It was absolutely perfect experience. 5 big stars to George! He is a terrific host. The place is spotless and location is superb.,1
George was friendly and helpful when we crossed paths. He was flexible with our odd hours. Place neat and clean with great views and convenient location for us. And all the action of the Southie waterfront. Recommended. ,1
"George was a great host, easy to communicate with and he greatly helped ensure a smooth and comfortable experience. ",1
"George's place is absolutely amazing.  The view of the harbor is breathtaking and I sat at the table each morning enjoying the sunrise and the coffee he provides.  The photos cannot do it justice.

I meet George when I arrived.  Great guy and then I had the place to myself.  Clean, nice private bathroom.  I was attending a convention at the World Trade Center which is a beautiful block and a half walk.  Amazing park across the street.  Walking distance to many fantastic restaurants.  Convenient to airport and anywhere you want to go.

This was half the cost of a boring hotel (and no outrageous taxes!).  I highly recommend you book it.  You will be extremely glad you did.",1
Great location. Clean room with a comfortable bed. No surprises. I did not meet George but he stayed in contact through AirBnb message system to make sure all was well.,1
"Lovely apartment, fantastic views! Lots of upscale bars & restaurants in the neighborhood. Convenient to the Silver Line & the Boston Innovation District. George was an attentive and responsive host. Highly recommend!",1
I never got a chance to meet with George. The apartment was great! U can see both sunrise n sunset with the huge window in the living room. The room is clean n spacious. Have my own bathroom n lots of privacy. Can't complain at all!,1
"George was very helpful and accommodating. private bathroom was clean. The place was close to the convention center, within a 15 min walk. Would recommend to others.",1
"Fab location, close to the airport, transport, and all the action in central Boston. Modern building with concierge, easy to find and easy to access. Apartment is clean, comfortable, quiet, has all the amenities and a spectacular view.  George is open, charming, a great conversationalist and an attentive and welcoming host.  I would return to George's place any time and warmly recommend it to other Airbnb guests. Thank you George!",1
"The stay was great, George was really quick to respond to txt messages, location is great, right in the heart of some awesome restaurants and close to everything.  Would definitely stay again.",1
"I would recommend staying at this Airbnb to anyone!! The view from the room was absolutely incredible, as was the view from the roof (which is open until 11:00 pm). My boyfriend and I enjoyed the restaurants/bars that surrounded the apartment...and we also loved being so close to the water.  Best trip to Boston we've had so far. ",1
I was very pleased to stay at George's apartment. It is very clean and neat. But what is really amazing is its fantastic location. I would definitely recommend and would stay there again!,1
"I never got to meet George in person, but he kept always in touch and was an excellent host, and an extremely kind person. He accommodated our early arrival and everything was ready when we got to his place. I highly recommend George and his condo! ",1
George could not have been more welcoming or hospitable. He went above and beyond to make sure we had a good stay. I can't imagine a better Airbnb host.,1
Great experience! No complaints whatsoever. Book it!,1
"Beautiful place, very easy to coordinate with George, very pleasant stay--would recommend! ",1
"George was a great host all around, with a great apartment with wonderful views.  Would highly recommend!",1
I can recommend without hesitation one of the best experiences in travel. I'm looking forward to returning. George made the stay pleasant and comfortable.,1
The location of the apartment was great and just a short walk into the city. The apartment had the comforts of home. Saw George only once and for only 2 minutes. Would go back there again. Nice view of the harbor! ,1
"I stayed in this apartment for 5 months over the summer while working in Boston. The apartment is situated in a really lovely residential area of Brighton with excellent transport links to both Boston and Cambridge, making it fantastic for commuting to work. The local area has great amenities including shops, restaurants, bars etc, and a public swimming pool and other sports facilities nearby.
The host Masha and her husband were extremely welcoming and helpful from the moment I arrived in Boston, which was very appreciated given that I was traveling alone and was far from home. They were always on hand if I had questions or needed anything. The apartment is quite spacious, clean and well kept. The kitchen has all the basics needed and the sofa comfortably sleeps a guest if required. The decked area outside was well used by me and makes for a lovely chill out area catching the afternoon sunshine. 
Overall my stay here was fabulous and I would totally recommend this apartment to those looking for somewhere homely to stay while in Boston. Indeed if I am ever back in town I will check out the availability of this place!",1
"I stayed in the apartment for a month in November, it is a very nice apartment with a separate bedroom, a plenty of storage place, and a fully equipped kitchen with all the necessary utensils. It also has a private washer/dryer for your use in a basement. It is located in a quite residential neighbourhood. Since I was there in November, it was quite chilly in the apartment on a colder days, but Masha kindly provided me with a small heater. Overall, I had a great stay there and I'm glad that I found this apartment for my initial stay in Boston. ",1
"We were very pleased with our stay at Masha's place, it was exactely what we had been looking for - proximity to the metro, quiet area and privacy. The apartment was clean and the bed very confortable. Masha's husband, Paul, even gave us an extra heater because he thoguth that I was a bit cold (the weather in Boston can be brutal at times). Great value for the money, we will stay here again during our future trips to Boston. Thanks Masha!",1
"This apartment had everything we needed and was very clean. We would definitely stay there again. We didn't have any issues with the temperature while we were there, and it was an unusually cold spell, even for Boston.",1
"Masha welcomed us the day we arrived, and her place is very cozy. It is located in a good neighborhood in Brighton, near grocery stores, public transportation, and within walking distance to a great coffee shop! Masha and her husband were gracious hosts, and during the epic snowstorms ensured we had everything we needed. They even gave us candles in case the lights went out. We would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others. ",1
"Masha was a very welcoming and helpful host to this private, well-kept apartment conveniently located in a quiet residential neighborhood. She provided her contact info upon arrival in case we had any questions. The apartment itself is decently furnished, very spacious, nice bathroom, with a private washer/dryer in the basement. The trains are about 15 minutes away by foot, with some cafes, Starbucks, CVS and some bars/restos along the way (Chestnut Hill Ave).  Bus 86 stop is just up the street from the apt which goes to Harvard station. Overall, a very comfortable stay.",1
I really enjoyed this staying in this place. Very nice and quiet perfect for 2 people because there are 2BR and 2BTHs. Would definitely stay here again. ,1
"The listing was everything described and more.  Great building and great location.  The apartment was modern, spacious and clean.  I would highly recommend this listing.",1
"Location was super clean, great price, in a great location, and exactly as advertised in photos. Getting the keys was stressful at the beginning of the stay but otherwise fantastic. Would stay there again when visiting Boston!",1
"Northeast Suites was easy, convenient, very clean, and comfortable.  The pictures very accurately depict the space.  It was easy communicating with the hosts and I'll certainly stay there again when in the area.  Overall a great experience!",1
"Easy check in, nice property, good location. Would stay at again. ",1
"Pros: The location and the apartment setup were extremely convenient - if you're looking for a pretty cheap place to stay the night that's super easy to get to from the airport, I would definitely recommend this place. Wi-fi was good. The towels and sheets were nice and clean.

Cons: The building (particularly the shared bathroom) was pretty dirty. I think it gets cleaned once a week, although some of the grime in the bathroom seemed older than a week. The fridge in my room was stained and smelled horrible when I opened it - luckily I didn't have to store any food during my stay.",0
"Great place to stay. Spacious room, really close to airport, safe neighbors. Definitely loved here.",1
The room is big and clean. The subway(Orient Heights) is just 2-3 minutes walk. I love this stay.,1
"The room was very nice for the price and just as described. Self check-in was easy the host was available by text to answer questions and give me directions. The room was very comfortable, we slept well, and enjoyed our time. Thank you.",1
"Host isn't onsite so I didn't meet her. She was SUPER responsive to my messages and questions. Check-in process was simple, room was perfect for my one night there to write quietly and sleep. Walking to the beach and the Mama Blanca restaurant for tasty food was easy, safe. I'd stay there again w/o hesitation. Thank you! ",1
Room was exactly as described. Excellent location near the airport.,1
It was an amazing stay. Everything was perfect !,1
Tidy room and comfortable bed. Very short walk to the train station to get into the centre of Boston. If I'm back in Boston I'd be happy to stay at Quinn-May's place again.,1
"Had a great stay here. Everything was as described. Spacious, clean and very close to Boston. Just a short walk to the subway and you arrive in the city centre within 15min.",1
"We stayed at Quinn-Mays place for one night after a long flight from Europe. It was the perfect place for us since we arrived in the middle of the night. The room is very close to the airport, and it was no problem finding it. The room was clean and spacious. Wi-Fi was fast. 
We would definitely stay there again, if it were for one or two nights. 
",1
Check in easy.  Lots of business near by.,1
Room worked well for us. Clean and close to the metro. Will stay again!,1
Very nice house! ,1
"List is accurate, host always has room ready.  Nice room at a reasonable rate (for Boston).",1
Always ready when I arrive. Enjoyed staying here.  Room had fridge w/ freezer. Comfortable.,1
"Good location and nice spacious room. All amenities were provided for, would recommend this place.",1
"The good: great location, it worked quite well for easy access to downtown Boston with only a two-minute walk to the T. The room was adequate for our needs.

The bad: cleanliness. The towels smelled, the showers had dirt and hair, the dishes had grime on them and the hosts only showed up once a week. This makes perfect sense to me for the rooms, but the common areas needed more attention. The room was in a position which exposed us to smoke from another resident (it came in from the outside porch) and light from the inside, as there was a window to the hallway.",0
"The place was really comfortable, everything was as described and better than than it looked. The location is amazing, the subway is really close and there is a unexpensive chinese restaurant nearby, which we utterly loved. Recomended %100.",1
"Everything was fine and we had clean bedroom. There was a fridge at our room and we could use the kitchen. The house is near by the train station, so it was easy to visit beautiful Boston. May was very friendly and told us everything we needed to know.",1
"Good experience. This place is pretty much a hostel. When we arrived, my name was on the door of my room and the room was orderly and clean. There are several other rooms in this place with other guests staying, reminds me of a dormitory. There is a communal bathroom, shower, and kitchen, which were all clean. We never saw any host and seldom ran into the other guests. We mostly used this room to lay our heads as we explored Boston. There is a CVS within walking distance and a really good pizzeria called Nicks that delivered. Also, the high point of this place, is the proximity of the Orient Heights MBTA station. You walk out the front door and be at the subway station in 3 minutes, and ride the blue line down to the airport or downtown in minutes. All around, a good experience. ",1
Very convenient for our quick stop in Boston before catching an early flight. Five minute walk to the train which runs to the airport. Basic room with a comfy bed. Easy to check in and out. Nothing flashy. ,1
"The location of the house is great, with restaurants, pharmacies and the blue line T train (which takes you to downtown) close by. The room itself is nice, it was clean and came with a fridge and AC unit. The bathrooms were pretty decent. One thing though is that behind the furniture next to the door there are gaps leading to the hallway because the window panes don't reach the floor. So if you have noisy housemates it might be a problem. Otherwise, I would stay here again for the price.",0
"Wonderful place to stay, very convenient in terms of transportation. Quiet at night. The bedroom is very comfortable as well.",1
"Good room, as shown in the photo. All amenities were as mentioned and we had no trouble in finding the apartment. Very close to station and very good place for an affordable price. Thanks for the stay! ",1
"Although we had to self check-in, everything was organized. The host had given us all the instructions and everything went well. We had no problem checking-in. The host also allowed us to store our luggage before and after check-in/out. The room itself was nice, with the air conditioner turned on before checking-in. All in all, the place was great and accessible with the Metro within walking distance.  ",1
"This place is like a student house. We stayed in a room and shared the kitchen and the bathrooms with 3 more groups of people, some of which live there as tenants. The room itself is spacious enough for a couple and perhaps a small child. Bedsheets and towels were clean and fresh. Perhaps also because we arrived on a Monday and the cleaning is usually done on Sundays. The fridge inside the room was handy. The kitchen was always a bit busy and there were not enough cutlery, dishes, and kitchen utensils to cook. Although we intended to cook, we ate out throughout our 4-day stay in the end. The bathrooms were not the cleanest ones in the world but were decent. We never met the host and the hostess but received enough information to get into the house. It was also very easy to find as it was only 3 min walking from the train/metro/subway station. One side note is that the house is right on the side of a big street and the isolation of the house is insufficient. If you are a light sleeper like me you might find it difficult to sleep as you can hear everything from other rooms and especially the noisy traffic. Also, the curtains and blinds were white and transparent so in summer it gets bright really early. ",0
"clean and nice room, just how you can see on the pictures. 

location is easy accessible, check in and check out worked well.

stayed there for 2 nights and we were quite comfortable with everything.

We didnt see the host but communication via email was perfect, quick and detailed responses, everything went smoothly

overall good stay, would stay again if I visit Boston, thank you ",1
Great location.,1
It's a fantastic stay ,1
Everything was clean and the room is located in a safe neighbourhood.,1
"The room is clean and is near the subway.
I like the beach too. ",1
This is a room only. Big and clean just a bit eerie. ,0
Nice room with affordable price. Really near the beach (although we stayed too short and didn't get a chance to enjoy it). Check in& out were very convenient which I loved most. Thank you!,1
The room was exactly as it was described. It's also good located. With the car we were in less than 10 minutes in downtown. ,1
"Seamless experience. Never met the hosts, but didn't need to. the door code details on the email and the instructions were enough to get straight to our room. was big enough for three of us. great location for easy access to the city as well as being super close to the airport. thanks!",1
"Very close to the metro station, max 15 mins to the city center. The host is very  communicatable, reply inquiries promptly. Room is clean and convient, with solely indoor fridge. ",1
"This place is amazing!  It's the nicest house on the entire street, everything is new!  The room came with a queen size bed that was really comfortable, the towels and sheets were high quality, and the room had been professionally cleaned when I arrived.  Super nice living room and kitchen, with everything I needed (dishes, cooking pots and pans, microwave, silverware) and having a washer/dryer in the apartment was really convenient.  The neighborhood is mostly residential, and it's close to a shopping plaza at the end of the street that has a big grocery store, place to buy wine and beer, a few restaurants, and breakfast place. The bus is also right there and it takes you to Harvard Square in under 10 minutes....could also walk to Harvard Square, but the bus is so convenient that I just took that most of the time.

Overall, just a great place and I definitely would stay here again.",1
"We had a wonderful stay at Tod's house. It is an immaculately clean house which gets sun light all the time! It is also located on a green neighborhood where there is a mall, groceries and restaurants - pretty much everything- within a walk distance! We had everything we need in the kitchen. It was also easy to go Harvard or downtown. Todd was a super welcoming and friendly host. We had a wonderful stay - we wanted to extend our stay but the house was already booked in advance! Thank you Todd, for making us feel at home in luxurious way in Boston. ",1
"Todd checked in with me to make sure I had everything I needed, and his house is great! Perfect location, easy to get to Harvard Square.  ",1
"Todd was a great host!  The home has a nice kitchen, a sitting area with a TV, and a deck! I originally booked my husband for a month long stay at one of Todd's other properties (a bedroom with a shared bath) but then Todd contacted me and said this property might better suit him for a month long stay.  I found that extremely thoughtful! We would definitely stay again.",1
Great stay all around. Spacious and very clean bedroom and bathroom. Close to bus stop. Would definitely stay here again.,1
"Todd's place is wonderful. Clean, updated, and good location. The bed was so comfy, towels were fluffy, and each room is private with locking doors and private locking bathroom. I would definitely recommend staying here!",1
It was a lovely experience. The place was extremely neat and clean and professionally managed. All amenities were available. Location too was good.,1
"Todds’s house was extremely well kept, clean and spacious. The bedrooms and bathrooms had everything we needed. We were in town for a convention and his place was a 10 min drive from downtown and Hynes Convention Center, very convenient. Even though we did not get the chance to meet Tod, he was always quick to response and attentive to our needs. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone! Thank you Todd!",1
"Todd was fantastic. He communicated clearly and made it clear that he was accessible for whatever I needed. The location is great, the place was clean and felt updated. Awesome bed! I slept great. Clean bathroom, fresh towels, and great living space to relax and watch some television. I would definitely recommend this place to any of my friends looking to stay in the Boston area. ",1
"It was nice and easily accessible , neighborhood was fine",1
"Todd was a great host - very personable and helpful. He thought of everything and made the stay very enjoyable.

The house was as described, recently renovated so new appliances and all. Safe area, walking distance to bus into Harvard Square and supermarket close by. 

Would happily stay again and recommend to anyone wanting to explore Boston!",1
Had a great stay at Todd's place. Very private and spacious room + bathroom. Will definitely be back.,1
"This apartment exceeded our expectations on all levels.  Beautiful, clean, well-lighted quiet rooms in recently refurbished building.  Complete kitchen. Congenial fellow tenants led to some stimulating dinnertime conversation. Ample street parking, near shopping center with grocery/drugstore. Easy bus ride to Harvard Square. You will not be disappointed.",1
"Very comfortable accommodations in a safe working class neighborhood 2 miles from Harvard Square.  Newly remodeled 3-story  town home set up for Airbnb community living.  I had a 12x12 private bedroom with a walk in closet, fast wifi, new hardwood floors, and a newly remodeled spotless bathroom. Path to the bathroom crossed a public area.  I did not uses the community kitchen or living area, but they were well appointed  and just what you would need.  I want to emphasize that the Airbnb presentation of this is somewhat misleading.  You are not renting an apartment.  This is a unique Airbnb community living space, but as such, it could not have been nicer.  Excellent for professionals or single parents visiting Harvard.  $7 Uber to Harvard Square or a$2.00 bus ride.  If you can handle the community living aspect, this is Airbnb in Boston at its best.",1
A very livable and comfortable room that Todd provided to me. It were  very cleaning and being quiet when you live in there.,1
"We had a fantastic experience during our 9 day stay at Todd's place. The property was in fantastic condition, it was immaculately clean and there were generous amenities. No need to bring soap, shampoo, body wash or even laundry soap.   Highly recommended. We plan on coming back!",1
"Todd's place is a great airbnb community in a nice and, from my impression over the course of five weeks, safe neighborhood. There are five rooms and three bathrooms in total in the house, I had a private bathroom across the floor of my room. The room was perfectly clean, beautifully designed and comfortable. People in the community were mostly academics staying for a couple of weeks or short-term visitors. The common areas were well-equipped and cleaned regularly. Todd wrote e-mails in advance, perfectly organized the arrival and responded to every question in short time. There is a star market close by, which also has a hubway station from where you can easily pick up bikes to go to Harvard or Boston. The bike ride to Harvard Yard is less than 20 minutes, a taxi ride from and to the airport takes 15 minutes. All in all, the apartment is perfect for visitors to Harvard University.",1
"Very nice house, nice landlord, nice and free breakfast. Good location. Very enjoy this experience, and highly recommend! ",1
"This 3BR apartment with kitchenette was BEAUTIFUL!!! We LOVED staying here.  The location was perfect, easy access to the bus and T, many eateries in walking distance.  The amenities and hospitality were SUPERB. David was very welcoming and made us feel right at home. We will recommend this bed and breakfast to anyone visiting Boston.  We will definitely be back.",1
Really clean and quiet places for visiting Boston. Host are very kind and thoughtful. Highly recommended!,1
"David was so responsive to a few special request and questions.  We loved that we had a private space within the stunning B&B.  It provided us with the apartment feel but the B&B amenities, like a yummy breakfast, which was amazing. 

The space is air conditioned and very comfortable.  The common space was perfect for our group of three couples to be able to relax and chat without utilizing one of the sleeping rooms. Having the exclusive access to the cupula was really special! 

The location is great - with shops and food just a 5 minute walk down the street.  We enjoyed a late night walk for some ice cream.  Parking was also a breeze, even with vehicles.

Our group agreed that if we needed a room for one night or had a small group this would be at the top of our list.  Thanks so much for the warm hospitality! ",1
"The house was beautiful, very open, yet very cozy. eveything was so comfortable. i wanted to stay for days.",1
"I loved everything about this listing! M is a great host who arranged for me to have easy and flexible access on my arrival. You know how when you travel you always feel great getting back to your own shower? Well, I got home and immediately missed this shower - it is tall with great pressure. I enjoyed the many dining options in Back Bay so I didn't really utilize the kitchen but very much appreciated that a Brita water pitcher was available for me. It looks *just* like the photos and M even left out some sundries in the bathroom had I forgotten any. The listing has 'small' in the title but it isn't overly small and was an advantage during the week of heat that the air conditioning could get the space down to temperature without having to leave it running while away. Also, this place is only about four blocks from Cheers. Yeah, that Cheers. Also, it is an easy walk to catch a game at Fenway Park in the other direction. I also made it down to the Museum of Fine Art (free on Wednesday night!). This was my first visit to Boston and I loved staying at this central location with the many parks. You're here because you appreciate the shared economy that we live in, well, Boston has both Uber and Lyft as well as Hubway, short term one-way bike rentals with stations all over town.
M provides a clean space with a comfortable bed and a great shower. Pretty much everything you could need!
Thanks for hosting me, M!",1
"Absolutely fantastic apartment!  Loved everything about it, and loved the building as well!

Not only this, the location of the apartment was amazing, set in the historic Backbay area which is a treat for architecture lovers as well as a nice walk into the centre of Boston.

Would highly recommend both Mila's apartment and Boston to everyone!",1
"The studio was very nice, a bit dark, but with everything that you could need for a comfortable stage. The bed is really comfortable, the shower very nice, the wifi works perfectly. Some noise from the condition air machines of the neighbourgs disturbs during the night, but this is not the owner's fault. M was very helpful and friendly, she even agreed to extent my check out time until 5pm according to my flight schedule and provided all the information I requested. Although we did not meet personally, she was always available and made communication very easy. The neeighbourghood is outstanding, very centric and safe and definetly appropriate for visiting Boston. Summarizing, an excellent place . I will not doubt to book it again if going back to Boston.",1
"I really enjoyed staying in this apartment. It is small, but very clean and comfortable. I stayed there for 3 weeks, so I used the kitchen a lot. The apartment provides everything you need.
The location is just perfect, you can walk pretty much everywhere, and the subway is in a 5 minutes walking distance as well.

  ",1
"My host was amazing :) She was fast in replying to my emails, she helped me out with the US adapter (she literally saved my trip!), and she was super helpful in everything. The apartment was very clean, perfect for one person. Located in the center, reachable to the main shopping malls (! :)! as well as perfect to have a walk in green parks. I would recommend this place to everybody who are staying in Boston and would like to have a great cozy place with a reasonable price :) Thank you so much for hosting me!",1
Thanks for the perfectly located Studio in back bay! Everything as described and perfect for a single person!,1
"This studio is in the perfect area for those wanting to explore Boston. It is a short walk to attractions such as Newbury Street (a great place to shop), Copley Square, the Boston Public Library, Boston Commons, and various restaurants. It also is within walking distance to public transportation (Copley Stop, Green Line) so you can easily get around the city.

The studio is located in a brownstone, giving you the full Boston feel while you are staying there. Plus, the price for the location is great! 

M is very attentive to your needs, and responds back quickly. For all the reasons mentioned, I highly recommend this place, and would definitely stay there again. :)",1
"Beautiful neighbourhood, beautiful place, and convenient for getting around.  My friend from Japan who stayed for 3 nights was extremely happy about the experience.  Thank you, M!",1
"This is a nice place. Not huge, but larger than a hotel room, with a kitchen. M was very accommodating. This is in a great Back Bay location - easy walking distance to do many things. The next time I'm in Boston, I'm going to ask M to stay there again. Thanks M!",1
Excellent location. Apt 100% ready for guests.,1
The description was very accurate and the apartment was very sweet.  The location was amazing!  It was exactly what I needed and I would definitely stay again!  M was very gracious and communicative all along the way.,1
"This studio apartment is located in a great location in the Back-Bay.  Was a perfect location to run the Boston Marathon.  Close to the finish line, and easy access to the running paths along the Charles River.  Was within easy walking of distance of everything I needed to have a great trip.  Mila was a great host and easy to communicate with.  The studio was clean and ready for me upon arrival.  Thanks!",1
"Host was very responsive to messaging and helpful in facilitating key pick up. The neighborhood was very walkable, centrally located, and fun to explore. The apartment was clean, well maintained, and comfortable; just as advertised. Would stay here again. ",1
M's apartment is perfect for one person - very cozy. Not the ideal spot if you're looking for a place to lounge. Easy to find and in a very convenient location. Everything that you need for a quick stay in Boston.  ,1
This place was absolutely perfect! The apt is small but charming and had everything we needed.  M even had coffee and creamer for us :)  The location was amazing and it was so easy to get around to all the sites in Boston.  Everything was very clean and tidy and M was very quick to respond to questions and made this whole experience a breeze.  Thank you and if I'm ever back in Boston I will certainly be staying here again! ,1
"This is a clean and cozy apartment on a beautiful tree-lined street in a killer Back Bay location. It's just a few blocks from lively Newbury Street, the gorgeous Boston Public Library and convenient T stops. Mila was a dream hostess, quickly responding to all inquiries and stopping by with extra towels . And the price can't be beat! Thank you, Mila, for the wonderful stay!  ",1
Perfect place. Wonderfully quaint and clean. Location was perfect for whale watching during the day (gorgeous 15 minute walk) and Fenway at night (easy 10 minute walk). Excellent food was within 2 minutes! Back Bay train station was close enough to walk with luggage. Bed was comfy...shower was great. Two thumbs up!!!,1
"Communicating with Mila was seamless. She contacted me very early on and checked in a few times between my booking and actual arrival. She sent a very thorough instructional email - easy to understand and follow upon arrival. The rental was just as described! The Back Bay neighborhood was charming, accessible, and so fun to walk around. Her apartment was tidy, with lots of amenities. Would love to stay at Mila's on my return trip to Boston. ",1
Everything great,1
Prompt and responsive. Took care of an issue when it came up!,1
We had a blast ! Great location and super clean. Within walking distance from pretty much everything.,1
"Mila has been wonderful! She answered all my questions almost right away and solved a minor problem within a couple of hours. Her studio is as ""advertised"", right in the heart of Back Bay and everything is at hand. Definitely a great host and a nice place to stay!",1
"Awesome location. Great space, clean and well designed. I would 100% stay here again. Also location is perfect!",1
Mila place was absolutely perfect for my trip to Boston! Excellent location and awesome host!,1
"Great location, very nice apartment. However, the first two nights I was missing:
-A/C unit (featured on listing...The temperature was really warm, this was early September, during the day it reached 90 degrees)
-Chairs for the round center table (the listing images have chairs)
-Shower curtain
-Trashcans for the kitchen and bathroom (never got these)
-Pans/pots for stove (never got these)

The lighting was poor as well, the main area were the bed and round table were only had a small spotlight-like light, that hardly illuminated the place.

Once I got most of the stuff I needed, the experience was definitely superior. With all the stuff mentioned above propoerly installed and available in the apartment,  I would give the experience 5 stars. However I only had a 5 star experience 4 of the 6 nights I stayed. I would've also given a 5 star rating if my issues would've been solved on the same day I got there.",1
"Great location, clean, neat and tidy! Well furnished and great for a single or couple. ",1
"The location of this rental ideal for a visit to Boston. The studio apartment is lovely, and looks pretty much exactly the same as the listing photo, but the building that houses it is run down. This particular unit is 4th floor walk-up. Not great if you travel with heavy luggage. There were ant traps and insecticides all over the kitchen, which made me uneasy, but I did not see any insects. 

Bottom line, given the opportunity to stay here again, I would decline.",0
"This apartment was fantastic! It's located in a beautiful brownstone building on Newbury, very close to some great restaurants and shops; pretty much anything you could want is within a 5 minute walk, including a drugstore and market less than a minute away!
The apartment itself is well-lit, spacious for a sing glee guest or a couple sharing a bed, and well equipped with the necessary amenities. I loved having a washer/dryer for my two week stay.
Flatbook's customer service people were fantastic, very quick to reply and helpful with any questions or concerns.
Overall, I would book here again in a heartbeat. You can't beat an apartment like this on the top floor of a central Newbury brownstone!",1
"Very nice flat in an awesome location - dozens of restaurants, bars, and shops just outside the door.  The Flatbook staff was super prompt in all of their replies and were flexible w/ my check-in and check-out times which I greatly appreciated.  I would absolutely stay here again and highly recommend it to anyone visiting Boston.",1
"Fantastic place in a great location that had everything we needed for a great three days in Boston. Flatbook staff were really helpful leading up to our stay, offering plenty of advice about things to do and see in Boston. Arriving and letting ourselves into the apartment was easy and fuss-free and the apartment itself was immaculate - very clean and had everything we needed, including a fully equipped kitchen and washing machine. Would definitely use Flatbook again, and recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Boston.",1
"I had a fantastic stay in Boston with Flatbook. The combination of the location on Newbury St with the low cost and quality amenities was primo! They made the reservation and subsequent communication process so easy. Although, when I arrived at the apartment, I didn't know the room number, so finding the right lock box for the given code gave off the ""I'm breaking into the place"" vibe to passerby's for a bit. Otherwise, honestly no complaints. Thank you so much for a great stay that also felt like home :)",1
"If you're planning a trip to Boston, stay here. This charming brownstone apartment along Newbury street will welcome you with a cosy interior, tons of natural light and very well designed layout. 

Boutique shopping and high street brands are literally seconds away from the apartment. Copley Square and Brooklyn Public Library are minutes away. 

Loved every bit of it. Thanks Flatbook!",1
"This listing's description was very accurate. Excellent prime location. Best thing about flatbook is that they give you your privacy, but are around if anything goes wrong. Would definitely deal with flatbook again, thanks guys!",1
"I had a great stay in this appartment. The ""plus"" is really its location, in the heart of back bay; the very central T station Copley is nearby. Newbury street is the most animated street of boston, along with  remaining calm at night (fortunately, because the windows don't have double glazing). The appartment was very clean, quite large, well decorated, with nice vue on the roofs of Back bay. I would recommend this appartment to visitors (including for business trip, on which I was when I came).

"Extremely efficient airbnb with a key in the lockbox outside, so no need to coordinate in person. Central in one of Boston's best neighborhoods, clean, and as advertised",1
"This place was great! So clean and fully equipped with everything you could possibly need, and a fantastic area to stay in! I walked almost everywhere. I highly recommend a stay here. Great quality living space! ",1
Easy check in a a real clean and cozy studio on a coolest street in back bay. Close to the subway and better than staying in the hotel. Coffee and tea provided as well as laundry det soap etc. highly recommended.,1
You need,0
The team at Flatbook was very responsive and helpful.  Access was easy and they were very accommodating with letting us drop pur bags hours before our checkin,1
Listing is very accurate. Apartment is clean and well decorated as shown in the photo. Very comfortable stay. The highlight of this accommodation is its location - right at the very heart of Boston's Newbury street -the most convenient location I could ever ask for! Be aware that the room is on the 4th floor with no elevator (this was not a problem for me and my mother though). The other big plus is Flatbook's attentiveness to guest's questions and request which makes our stay perfect. ,1
"A welcome introduction to Airbnb. Based on this experience, I will certainly be staying here again when next in Boston and have now staring using Airbnb elsewhere. Thank you. ",1
We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment gave us plenty of space and was very comfortable. We had prompt and friendly responses from Flatbook when we got in touch. We'd stay here again if we return to Boston.,1
"Great location for the Hynes Convention Center, tons of good places to eat/drink/shop nearby, and a quick walk from Copley station. Not much in the way of personality, but clean, air conditioned, and with all the stated features. One nice bonus: the Internet was pretty speedy (consistently over 2 megabytes per second, and as high as 5, which is faster than 99% of hotels).",1
"We booked this for four people and it was clearly described as having two separate beds (see reservations). It was also clearly described as being for 4 people.

When we arrived there, the apartment was clearly for only 2 people. No second bed, no sofa bed.  We contacted Flatbook and they indicated it was their mistake, and we were entitled to a full refund, with no cancellation fees. 

We left on the same day, July 21st, about 1 hr after we got in, and we found another solution for our stay in Boston. We put the key back in the keylock.

Needless to say, this was a major problem which I never had before with any AirBnb reservations.  Extremely disappointed, as we planned our entire vacation around staying in BackBay

On top of that, I didn't hear anything back from Flatbook about getting a full refund.

Flatbook indicated they swapped the sofabed  with a sofa the day before our arrival. Now, this is a BackBay 4th floor with no elevator. The two sofa look identical in the pictures so this explanation doesn't seem right .

We expect a full refund as it was promised by the Flatbook team on the phone (Maya and Olivia).

I highly recommend *not* to book from Flatbook in the future. Certainly we never will do it again. I am surprised that AirBnB that has such a good reputation, let them host properties on AirBnB.

"Very convenient location for shopping/tourist activities. Many restaurants nearby. The apartment itself is well appointed but wasn't fully cleaned when arrived. This plus ants, mosquitoes (not sure how they got in), and stuffy 4th floor heat in July (there is AC but it's pretty loud) made it a convenient but not particularly comfortable stay.",1
The apartment was exactly as described and photographed. It was clean and spacious. It is in an ideal location. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. ,1
This was a gold standard Airbnb. The host emailed me beforehand with simple instructions on finding the key. The building is in great shape. The flat is exactly as the photo shows and actually better because of the well equipped kitchen. The location is terrific. Trader Joes and Peets coffee just around the corner. The host thought of everything and was responsive when we had an issue with the city shutting off that water one morning for road work. ,1
Great location to everything with easy walking access to whatever and where ever. ,1
"beautiful apartment, beautiful location. can't wait to come back!",1
The Carney Family graciously agreed to allow us to stay an extra night; it seemed that they are doing some redecorating. Their home was near a T station that allowed us to venture into Boston city relatively easily. The robes and slippers were a nice touch!,1
"By far our favorite place in Boston!! Understated elegance.Great hosts! A must! if you use Airbnb. You will NOT be dissapointed!!!
",1
"Barney was very friendly and welcoming. It really helped that he is a native of Boston as he knows what the city has to offer and is very happy to share. The room was very comfortable, the neighborhood was safe and the metro station was only a 5 minute walk from their home. For me it's always fun staying in a neighborhood away from the main sites as you get to see parts of a city that you wouldn't normally have the opportunity to see - and the location isn't far from these sites either. I would definitely stay with the Carney's again! ",1
"We liked our stay with the Carney family a lot. The hosts were really friendly and hospitable; they arranged an extra bed for us. The sleeping room is very spacious. Attached is a nice living room, kitchen and luxurious bathroom, which we had to share with two language students we hardly saw. 
The house has a nice backyard with immediate access to the beachfront. The JFK library and a metro stop are nearby. The hosts connected us with their children who were performing in a restaurant in Provincetown, Cape Cod. We went to see them and had a lovely night. 

I would really recommend a stay at the Carney's during your next visit to Boston. ",1
"The Carney residence is *beautiful*, very quiet, super clean and  most comfortable. The Carneys are among the nicest people I've ever met; they went above and beyond the call of airbnb hosts' duty, offering helpful advice for sightseeing, discount shopping and tire repair -  including help with finding the repair shop and a ride offer back to the house. Thank you so much, Mary & Barney! I will be back for sure! ",1
"This is a 5 star luxury accommodation except that wouldn't mean much to me unless the hosts were warm and helpful.  Well, these hosts are 5 star too.  They are very good people who have tried to think of everything a guest might require.  Even little sensor lights go on to guide you to the loo at night.  It is very comfortable and yes the water views are delightful.  It is a very special place with very special and beautiful hosts.  You must go there.  They are right near the train too.  Lovely kitchen for your own use.  We hope to visit again.",1
"There are several reasons why you stay at the Carney Family:
 
1) The price is far too low compared to what you get. We slept in a lovely and perfectly clean room with new towels, fresh bed linnen, bathrobes and even new slippers.
2) The Carney Family is so kind and responsive to any request you might have. 
3) It is easy to get around Boston from here because the Savin Hill subway station is just nearby. 
4) The breakfest you can get a McKenna's - just near Savin Hill Station - is absolutely fanstastic. It's greasy but even if there is no room at the Carney Family, you should consider going there. 
5) There is a good cup of coffee waiting for you in kitchen when you get up. 
6) When we arrived we welcomed by Barney who had some very good sugestions on where to go.

All in all, it was really nice laid back atmosphere that greeted us at the Barney family. And staying there difinitely improved our stay in Boston. This is by far the best experience we've had on AirBnB. ",1
"The Carney Family were extraordinarily welcoming  and I could not have asked for more. Really enjoyed staying here - great hosts, great location, very clean, and well kept. Would go back in a heartbeat!",1
"The Carney's got our vacation off to a great start. Mary was waiting for us on the front porch when we arrived and gave us a very warm welcome into their home.  We met Barney as we were finishing our tour and helped ourselves to homemade cookies!   We had great access to the T, a large, comfortable room, and the best coffee in town.   The only wrinkle in our stay was some noise from others who were up earlier than us in the house, which led us to get up a bit earlier than we had planned.  Other than that, we had a fantastic stay with the Carney family.  One unexpected treat was the pleasant breakfast we shared with a couple from Australia. We shared stories and laughs over tea, coffee, and bagels.  A great place to stay in Boston!!",1
This was my first experience with Airbnb and definitely not the last. The Carneys were extraordinary. The room was great and everything was arranged for me and my friend to have a pleasant stay. Barney even took the initiative to help us finding things to do in or out of the city (thanks for the Blue Hills Reservation recommendation). The location of the house was just perfect (5-10 min walk from the subway station) in a very quiet and peaceful neighborhood. I definitely recommend this place.,1
"Huge room, made up immaculately. High ceilings and Victorian beauty. Strongest recommendations to go.",1
"Excellent accommodations, and Mary and Barney were very kind and helpful to us. I'd gladly stay there again!",1
"First thing about our stay that must be mentioned was the hospitality. We were made to feel very welcome, with the Carneys taking great care to explain the location of everything in the house.

We were told to help ourselves to whatever was in the fridge, and they even went out of the way to make muffins for us(delicious!)

Secondly, the room and board. 

The house is old but very well maintained. There is a sense of history that is almost palpable. The room was big and had most things you could possibly need, the only exception being a TV, but honestly, to us it was no loss. The bed was big and comfortable and the ambience made us feel relaxed.

Finally, the location.

The house is very well located, 5-10min from the MBTA station. Downtown and most of the attractions are within a 30 minute journey. The neighborhood is quiet, safe and welcoming.

All in all, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would stay there again.

"This was my first time using Airbnb and I really lucked out with the Carneys. Barney and Mary are wonderful, kind, considerate hosts with a true gift for making guests feel at home. I adored their big old Victorian home on a quiet street in Savin Hill. My room was cozy, clean, well-decorated, and spacious. I also enjoyed sitting out on the big wooden porch out back in the evening. There is a great Indian restaurant up the street on Dot ave as well as a lot of good Vietnamese places. One of the highlights of my trip was my early-morning chats with Barney. He does indeed make the best cup in Boston, as well as great muffins. He is well-informed, tolerant and laid-back. I hope to be back (if I can snag a room because they are quite popular and rightly so!) Stay here and you will not be disappointed. The Carneys make Boston proud.",1
"Lovely stay in an older, beautiful home.  Hosts were very attentive to our needs, but afforded privacy as well. Nice touches - access to kitchen to cook, if desired.  Coffee and delicious muffins waiting each a.m.  Robes and cozy towels.  Everything was clean and well organized.  Home is very well situated to access Boston by train (walk a few blocks to train) - a very short ride to the city center.  ",1
"We had a wonderful three nights stay at the Carney Family's house in Dorchester, Boston. It was the grand finale of our honeymoon trip. The Victorian-style house (from 1840, I think) is beautiful and very roomy. Our room was cozy and comfortable, with free use of bath robes and slippers. At the time of our stay we were the only guests in this part of the house, so we had a full apartment with living room, fully equipped kitchen, bathroom, laundry room and a back porch all for ourselfs. There were orange juice, bagels, fruits, fresh coffee and selfmade muffins for breakfast. Also the location was just perfect. You can take a walk along the bay and the subway station is just a 5-10 minute walk away. The Red Line takes you in just 15 minutes to Downtown Boston and with only one transfer to the airport. Very easy!
On our stay we met our host Barney, his son John and his neighbor Karen, who were all very friendly and helpful. If we return to Boston sometime, we would definetly stay again at the Carney Family's house. This place gets an A+ from us and is highly recommended!!!",1
"The Carney house is a magnificent place to stay.  The house is on a tree lined street of similiar houses and seems like an idyllic New England scene.  Our room was excellent and included the use of a shared little sitting room, kitchen, bathroom  and laundry.  Mary was very welcoming to us when we arrived and was helpful in answering questions about our trip into downtown Boston.  The house is so convenient to the T line and we left our car there to avoid having to drive into downtown.  We left early on our checkout day so didn't get a chance to have the famous muffins.  i hope we will stay there again as it was a great experience.",1
My wife and I very much enjoyed our stay with the Carney Family. Mr. Carney provided all the information that we needed about riding the Red Line Train to Boston and nearby Harvard. The Carney home is located within walking distance of the Red Line so we parked the car and didn't use it until we left.,1
We enjoyed our stay very much! The Carneys were really nice and we'd stay with anytime again.,1
"Carney family are very nice during our stay. John, the son greet us and introduce the room and facilities. We met Barney later that he provides some good suggestion of exploring Boston. We also had some interesting conversation with Barney and the other guests. 
Barney baked muffins for the guests everyday that is a nice touch! Barney and Mary are very helpful during our stay. Karen, the neighbor who helps the house, is also very friendly and helpful.

The bedroom and bathroom are clean and comfortable. It is also very thoughtful to have some extra towels in the bathroom for people to use. The location is convenient which is about 10 mins walk from the subway station. 

Overall I recommend this place for visitors to stay. You will have a good time in Boston.",1
"You travel for 6/7000km and you ain't mind about finding a piece of your home like I've done.
Carney family is the real american family with the bigest care I've ever met from unknown persons.
They are all so sweet and kind. Be prepared for a hard settle...leave or staing there.
I'll wait for good news from ""The carnivores"" debut LP
All my best wishes you're wonderfull :-) big hug from Italy.

My boyfriend and I were visiting Boston for the 1st time and we loved our stay with the Carney Family. Barney and Mary were warm and welcoming hosts. The room we stayed in was spacious and the kitchen and bathroom were very clean. The robes and slippers were a great touch. And the muffins and coffee were perfect!  For an added bonus the T station was an only short walk away. We had a fantastic stay and would definitely come back the next time we're in Boston. Thanks Carney Family!,1
The Carney's home is comfortable and inviting. Close walk to the T in an interesting neighborhood near the shore. Very safe and a super-easy commute to downtown and Cambridge. ,1
"From the moment we arrived (much later than anticipated in the evening), Barney made us feel like family and not only greeted us kindly, but with a full history of the house and the area. You can see the pride with which he cares for his house. 

Every room feels private, spacious and clean. It is just like staying in a top-notch B & B, but at a reasonable price Every last detail was accounted for, including the bath robes, slippers and water glasses in the room. Barney's promise of homemade muffins and orange juice was met and we lingered in the bright, open kitchen in the morning to enjoy them. 

What a treat to stay here!!! We will definitely come back every time we are in the area. 

Thank you for such a wonderful stay.

We loved and enjoyed our stay here .the room was very comfortable and spacious.The house is very posh and classy. The carneys  have spared nothing to make our stay more enjoyable. They accomodated us with everything we need . The neighbourhood is very safe and close to the subway . Also the house is close to this beautiful lake which is a wonderful place for hiking and enjoying nature. We recommend this place it is one of the best things about boston. We will definitely come back !,1
"Would have been nice if they'd refunded even 1 night, since i was sick and gave them more than 24 hours notice I had to leave. Instead they ignored me. ",0
"Our stay at the Carney BNB was very nice.  It was very convenient to the Red Line and most importantly, to our daughters apt.  Also, the house is located so that you get a pretty view of the water and at the end of the yard you can walk to the park and the little beach.

Did not see much of the hosts but we were very busy and out most of the time.  They were helpful and were very nice to contact us that we left a shirt behind. They held it for us to pick it up on our return to Boston 3 days later.  Very nice place.",1
"I had an amazing stay at Carney's. The hosts are friendly and very meticulous. They made sure everything was proper from the kitchen needs to the bedroom needs. Also, they made us feel like we are at home. My parents had come for my graduation and they were pleased that I did not book a hotel and instead chose to stay here. I would recommend everyone to book a room if ever they plan to come to Boston and enjoy an enriching confortable experience. ",1
"Our stay in Boston was great. Barney's Master Bedroom meets up to its standards. It is close to the Metro, ad Barney's advise of eating out was valuable.
As true Bostonian's Mary and Barney made us feel at home. ",1
"Such a great place to stay. Friendly hosts, comfy bed. We were even dropped off to continue our journey. Very handy to the station for a quick trip into Boston. A very interesting area full of charming houses including the Carney home.",1
"Though the stay was short, it was entirely enjoyable and the hosts make every effort to make it as comfortable as possible. Also they are very attentive on leaving detailed directions on access by train, etc, directions to room which is very assuring on a busy trip! ",1
"Beautiful House in Boston, lovely Family. A place to be! Shame on us, we only stayed for 2 nights. Next time, we'll stay longer!",1
"We thank Barney, Mary and the rest of the Carney Family very much for the perfect time we had in Boston and at their house. The house is very nice and spacious and the Master Bedroom was perfect for the three of us. Everything was very clean and Barney's coffee is one of the best we have tasted so far. It made our mornings. Also very nice is the balcony of the house where you can enjoy the view of the garden and the little bay in the back of the house. The beachwalk was very nice for an evening walk. The connection to the centre of Boston and Cambridge is very easy by the red line (subway). And on top of all, we felt very welcome and were very happy to meet the members of the family. Thank you for all the advice you gave us for our visits to Boston and for everything else! We can recommend this air bnb 100%.",1
"Staying at Mary and Barney's was just great. Their place is a beautiful mansion, just beside the seaside, in a quiet neighbourhood. Mary kindly gave me all the necessary instructions upon my arrival and made me feel at home. The house is walking distance to T station and only 10 minutes train to central Boston. It's perfect, whether you planned sightseeing or just chilling out. Would thoroughly recommend, and will definitely visit again in the future. ",1
"The home was beautiful, the room was beautiful, and the whole kitchen and living room availability was fantastic. The other guests were very enjoyable to mingle with. So many of them brought in food from nearby markets and cooked quite a bit.
But for me, the best part of the stay there was Mary. I think Mary's one of the nicest people I've ever met, and she went out of her way to be gracious and kind, and made my stay so very pleasant.",1
Great experience with this host. The room and other accommodations matched the description on the site. The location of the house is convenient to the Red line. Will stay with this host again once back in Boston.,1
"We had a wonderful time at the Carney Family's home!
The house is beautiful, clean, with a fully equiped kitchen, and is very well situated (only 10 minutes walk from the T train). Also, Mary and Barney are very welcoming hosts!
In short, we couldn't have ask for better! ",1
"My wife and I stayed at the Carney’s house in Savin Hill in “Barney’s Master Bedroom” for 4 nights at the beginning of August.  Barney and Mary were extremely welcoming, and gave us a great restaurant recommendation when we got into town late on Saturday. The Carney’s provided us with a comfortable bed, bathrobes, slippers, fresh fruit, and Barney’s delicious homemade muffins every morning.  To say they met and exceeded our expectations is an understatement.  The house is beautiful, in a safe neighbourhood and a 7-10 minute walk to the T (red line).  Great location for going downtown, Cambridge, the Kennedy Library and Museum, and really any place you want to go in Boston.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and we couldn't have asked for anything more.  Thanks to Mary and Barney for everything, we had a fantastic stay and will come back the next time we’re in Boston!",1
"We had a great time at Carney's home. The room is very spacious and bright, there is a nice living room that we could sit for a while and have a chat. Breakfast is provided for the guests and Barney bakes fresh muffins everyday. We could meet Barney at night and he gave us really good suggestions on where to see, eat, etc. there is also a nice lady who takes care of cleaning (unfortunately I don't remember her name) that gave us a ride to show around the place. Actually everything was beyond our expectation, we enjoyed a lot our stay in Boston. Don't doubt to push the book button! ",1
"My wife and I stayed at the Carneys' for three nights and we could not have been happier. The room was spacious and spotlessly clean, the breakfast was awesome, Barney's muffins were just to die for, only the best ingredients. Mary and Barney were a pleasure to talk to and they went above and beyond to make our stay worth while.",1
Mary and Barney were great hosts for me.  The room was just as described and offered a nice retreat.  It was perfect for my needs.,1
"We had a great time at the Carney's house. The room was spacious and nice, even the additional bed was really comfortable. In the morning there were coffee and muffins - a nice start in the day.

It's a straight walk to the Red Line that takes you to downtown crossing, Harvard square, etc. We met Barney, Mary and Robert, all were very helpful. Overall, we had a pleasant experience staying at the Carney's beautiful home and we enjoyed the lovely neighborhood as well. We would definitely stay here again.

The room was amazing. Exactly like it was shown in the picture. Quiet area. Quick walk to the small local beach which is literally in their backyard. The hosts were also very hospitable. I was in Boston for three days just to decide whether I should move there or not? Well I am sold.,1
"Our stay at Barney's was by far the best we've had through airbnb. Everything little detail was accommodating, from the rolled up towels on our bed to the muffins Barney baked for us in the mornings. The location was superb as well. My mother and brother both commented that this felt like a second home :)",1
"Mary sent us detailed directions the day before we arrived. The room was really nice, huge and clean. We got a good breakfast in the morning - with freshly baked muffins. Barney and Mary are very friendly and attentive hosts. All in all we had a most pleasant stay! ",1
"We had a great stay with the Carney family. The house and rooms are beautiful and close to the Train station. More importantly, the hosts were so kind and generous, it really made us happy. 

We will definitely stay there again. An enthusiastic  recondition! ",1
"My second stay with the Carney's.
It was a new room. Love staying here. Great location and great accommodations .
Everything is always so welcoming and beautiful.
Close to the T, off street parking. Great restaurant nearby as well.",1
"Even before we arrived, the communication was superb. 
The Carney Family made us feel welcome right from the beginning. The beautiful house is in a great part of Boston, close to the Red Line. The provided breakfast food added an extremely nice touch to the stay.",1
"This beautiful old house is a real home away from home. The Carney Family have really pulled out all the stops to make this a great Airbnb experience. As hosts they were very friendly. Hands off but there whenever we needed anything. At times it felt like we had the whole place to ourselves. They provided fresh muffins, fruit and coffee everyday. The bathroom, kitchen and lounge were all spacious, clean and comfortable.

As for as Airbnb listings go this has to be one of the best I've stayed in. I cannot recommend it enough!",1
This was my third time staying with the Carney's. And each time I have stayed in a different room. I always feel welcome and all of the rooms have been first class.,1
Another great stay in snowy Dorchester. Barney pointed out I left a shirt behind; remains a top host of any place I've stayed.,1
"It's really a great experience living in the one hundred years house,the room is exactly same with pictures, and more spacious with large living room,kitchen,rest room and laundry room. The location is also great,very near to the red line, it's convenient to the central area and south station.
Everyone in the house is quite nice,especially the host,they provided us every kind of suggestions patiently, we can enjoy delicious muffins,fruits and coffee every day.
I can't recommend it any more,I want give it 10 stars if it has.",1
"Amazing Host Family in a beautiful home. This was my third stay with the Carney's and I will keep referring friends and family to them who visit Boston, as well!! 5 Stars :) ",1
It was such a cute house and a lovely home to stay in.  The Carney's made us feel so welcome upon arrival and were great hosts.  Can't wait to visit again. ,1
"I have stayed with the Carney's many times. I always have a wonderful, welcoming stay.

"I enjoyed my stay in Barney and Mary's beautiful house. The neighborhood is a such safe and quiet area. And a cozy beach just near by the house. Barney and Mary served really nice bed, good muffins, fresh fruits and coffee everyday, and low-fat yogurt as well! I believe this is the most comfortable trip that I ever had. Thank you very much!",1
"This was one of the most comfortable places I've stayed. The Carney family was gracious and friendly and provided more than they needed for my comfort. The room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. The kitchen allowed me to feed my tea addiction. I loved the homemade granola and muffins for breakfast. And the view from the back porch was beautiful. I also met some really great people in the house who were fellow travelers. I would highly recommend this room for anyone who loves traveling, but also enjoys the comforts of home.",1
"We enjoy our staying at Carney family 's house very much! They provide everything you will need or more while you are away from home and stay at a hotel. Slipper, hair dryer, extra blanket, portable heater in case you feel cold and even the K-cup machine for coffee and tea. Mary made delicious and heathy muffins in the morning. I woke up at 7, the muffins are already on the table! Great host and nice house! Highly recommend!",1
The host was extremely welcoming. Gave us useful tips on places to see and easiest way to to get there. The house was very cozy and will I will definitely stay here again in the future.,1
We had a very nice stay! Everything was well prepared and clean! We would come back for sure!,1
I was so perfectly comfortable in this home and I felt like a princess in this home. The space was absolutely perfect and the muffins were really lovely.,1
Mary and Barney were very kind and helpful. They gave great directions to their home and it was very easy to find.  The room was warm and comfortable and I had everything I needed.,1
"Really lovely place! If felt very private and extremely cozy and comfortable. I slept perfectly. I had to get there late, and Barney gave me great directions for how to get in and manage/find everything once I was inside. Both he and Mary made the whole experience feel very welcoming. I felt very safe and Mary's granola was shockingly phenomenal. I would 100% stay there again. ",1
"Very welcoming and friendly atmosphere! I would definitely recommend it;) Thank you Barney anb Mary, cheers Flora",1
"The Barney's rock. The place rolls. The experience is better than a disco show. I had a great time....better than the Dead show at Red Rocks in 1862. I wasn't there, but I heard it was out of this world. And seeing that legalized slavery still existed in 1862, that Dead show must have been....oops I'm supposed to be reviewing the Barney experience. Three words: it rocks! Oops, that was two words. It super rocks!",1
"My mom and I had a very pleasant stay here. The room that we stayed in, Barney's master bedroom T downtown, was especially nice as it was very large, clean and close to the kitchen, laundry room and was located on the 1st floor (we had large luggage so this was great). Barney and Mary are very nice people, too. They were very obliging and took the time to answer our questions. Also, the muffins that Barney made were some of the best I have ever had. Highly recommend this place as it has a great combination of value, comfort and convenience.",1
"We enjoyed our visit. Thank you. We felt very comfortable and at home. The host, Barney,  was very helpful and personable. The accommodations were as described &  location was within easy walking distance to transit. The morning muffins were excellent. We loved staying in this historic home in a  historic and quiet neighborhood, adjacent to Malibu Beach and walking trail.",1
"We had a great time at Barney's home. The room is very spacious and bright, living room is nice and kitchen has everything we needed. We could even print out Redsox baseball game tickets using a computer and a printer in the living room. Breakfast is provided for the guests and Barney bakes fresh muffins everyday. Barney gave us really good suggestions on where to see, eat, etc. We enjoyed a lot our stay in Boston. ",1
Barney and Mary's  home is perfect! Great location and a very nice accommodation. They are very generous and welcoming. We really enjoyed our stay. Will definitely come back there when I visit Boston again!,1
"Lovely neighborhood, in walking distance to UMass Boston, which was the purpose of my trip.  There were also restaurants in easy walking distance.  Great location and beautiful old house.  The room was large and clean, but right next to the main entrance for the house.  If you go to bed early and/or are a light sleeper, bring earplugs or a white noise maker to block out the sounds of people coming into the house in the evening.  I am an early riser and was very happy to have the keureg coffee maker available, right near my room, to make my coffee before anyone else arose.",1
"We had a lovely stay with the Carney family.  They were gracious and helpful and their home was in the perfect place to explore Boston.  Thanks so much!  Next time we're in Boston, we'd love to stay again!",1
"When we arrived, the host was not there, so we had to find the room ourselves, which was fine. The hosts were very friendly and accommodating. The room was clean. However, the bed is very squeaky, meaning that if the other person turns or moves, it gets really loud. Also, as some of the other reviewers said already, the bed is right next to the entry door of the whole building. During our night, we woke up a few times from people entering. ",0
This time I enjoyed live music playing in the house when I returned from dinner. A mainstay for me when I need a place to stay in Boston. Always a pleasure.,1
"Mary and Barney are very nice and accommodating. My friend and I had a short stay, but we feel being at home while staying at their place. They gave out very detailed parking directions and check in details. We forgot to bring toothpaste and they're nice to borrow us some. Overall very nice stay.  ",1
Very nice house and hosts! We had a great stay at the CarneyFamily. Thanks a lot. It is also really easy to get into Boston.,1
"I had a good time, the room was very nice and the muffins and granola for breakfast were excellent. I also appreciated the water and bathrobe in the room. Would definitely stay here again! ",1
"The location is good, just outside of downtown Boston, though a tube ride is really required to get into the main city. The room was large and spacious and while a safe is provided for valuables, there is no lock in the room, nor the doors to the house. So long as you are happy to keep your stuff in a suitcase, the room is good, as there is not much storage space. Very good coffee and granola are available for breakfast. It was very nice to have a kitchen in which we could cook and did not always need to eat out.",1
"Wonderful family, wonderful house.
It is within easy reach of tourist attractions and Boston Convention Centre.",1
I would like to echo all the wonderful reviews here. I stayed for four days on a recent trip and everything was just lovely. The room and entire home are beautifully decorated and super clean. The Carney's are warm and gracious hosts. The neighborhood is beautiful and quiet and a nice respite after sightseeing in the bustle of then city. This is where I will stay on any future trips to Boston.,1
"The CarneyFamily residence was my first AirBnB experience, and they couldn't have left me with a better impression of the experience. The host was helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable. The room was clean, spacious, comfortable, and beautiful. WiFi, coffee, parking, and breakfast were all provided effortlessly. Public transportation is close. Excellent all around.",1
The Carney House is in a beautiful part of old Boston close to the subway so it was easy to travel into town. The room was large and very comfortable and the neighbourhood quiet. Breakfast was left in the fridge and kitchen for us to help ourselves to which was nice. We did a self check  and check out so we did not meet any of the Carney Family. We felt a little strange staying in someone's home without meeting our hosts.,1
"The hosts are very friendly and hospitable. The rooms were very spacious, and breakfast was available every morning. I particularly enjoyed the muffins Barney baked every morning. I had a really good time, and definitely hope to stay again!",1
"Amazing hosts and excellent place to stay! Room was clean, spacious and very comfortable. We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend this place to everyone.

Thank you Barney and Mary! ",1
"Home was beautiful, Carneys were wonderful hosts. There was water waiting for us in our room, comfy robes with slippers to use, and homemade muffins and granola for breakfast. They sent us easy to follow instructions on how to arrive from the airport and get around the city.",1
"The room and facility were great & clean. We had a wonderful time. Mary is a very nice and charming host, everything was very simple and comfortable. Last, location was great! ",1
"This is just home away home ! The house setting is just as warm as the host, Barney and Mary.  Accommodation place is  exactly what the pictures display.  What should I say, if you were in the place, it is far more better than the pictures.  8-9 min easy walk to subway (called T in Boston), if you have the 7 days Boston T pass which called you USD20 for unlimited T and bus ride, you can also take one station to JFK T station and there you can find supermarket.  Thanks Barney and Mary to give me such good place to stay.    ",1
"We had a great stay! The room had everything we needed and was quite comfortable. The house was interesting, welcoming and accessible. ",1
We had a geat time at the Carney's wonderful house. The room was spacious and comfortable. It's only a short train ride to the city centre but located in a quiet and nice area.,1
Great place to stay. Very convenient and lovely hosts. House was amazing and room is so much bigger than any hotel. Really clean. Felt like home from home. The area is very safe.,1
"This location was perfect and the house was gorgeous. I would recommend this place to anyone.  I have never used this service before, but I will definitely do it again.",1
"Staying in this beautiful house was great. Everything was clean and convenient, the indications were clear and once arrived, it's easy to get to the city center with the subway. Thank you for your hospitality!",1
"This is my second time in Barney's place, and it never disappoints! The master bedroom is very spacious. The bed is very comfortable. One day it was very hot so I took advantage of the air conditioning that is included in and controlled from the room.

The place is very charming, clean, and safe. Parking was no problem, even though I got back at 1am one night and 5:30am another night! It was also very relaxing to sit on the back porch sipping coffee and enjoying Mary's homemade muffin.

Highly recommended for any guest!!",1
"We really enjoyed our stay at Barneys and it was a great way to finish our 8 week holiday.  It was easy to find and not too far from the station to walk. Also easy to get to and from the airport with one change from the train (red line) to the airport bus (silver line). The location was really nice with lovely old period houses in a leafy neighbourhood.  The house was great, with plenty of room, a large sitting room and back verandah overlooking the garden to relax.
The bedroom was large with a bathroom off the kitchen area, just around the corner.  The use of the kitchen, fridge and laundry were very welcome.  Barney was very helpful with our requests and we really appreciated his help. Breakfast provided was plentiful and very much appreciated. Highly recommend staying here, it was most enjoyable. ",1
"This is a lovely big house in a charming and quiet neighborhood about a five minute walk from the nearest metro station.  The room is big and comfortable even with an extra bed in the corner. The extra bed was very comfortable.

Breakfast was simple but exactly what we like to eat including fresh home made muffins each morning. There was room in the fridge for us to have food and the kitchen was at our disposal.

Barney is very chatty, helpful and informal. I got clear instructions on how to check in before I arrived and there was a sheet of useful information in our room like nearby restaurants, grocery stores and taxi services. Barney was happy to make additional recommendations when we had questions.

I would be very happy to stay here again!",1
"The room we stayed is very large, beautiful and comfortable.I not met Barney but he promptly answered all my questions. The Girleide, who made our check in was very helpful with us. The house is a short walk from the subway.",1
"The Carney's were fantastic hosts. The accommodations were very comfortable. We had a late night arrival, and Mary sent good instructions, left us water on the mantle, and delicious muffins in the kitchen. We love the Savin Hill neighborhood. Very beautiful, and close to the T and the JFK Library. Mary and Barney have a beautiful home, which they graciously and unobtrusively share with their guests. We'd stay there again in a minute. ",1
"Great location, - close to T line, Great  in house facilities, Great breakfast, Great house in a fantastic old neighbourhood, (the tallest ceilings imaginable), Great city with the absolute best amenities to suit all tastes, whats not to like?",1
"I stayed with the Carney's in September 2015. It was a very enjoyable stay. They are a 10 minute walk from the T (Boston subway). The room was clean and tidy and they even left water in the room for you. They provide a safe which was a plus. The kitchen had a fridge, coffee (provided by the Carney's), and dishes. Also provided muffins every morning which was a wonderful plus. I would suggest this stay for anyone wanting to see Boston but not pay $300+/night at a hotel.

Thank you Carney's!",1
"We absolutely loved our stay with the Carney Family!  The location is fantastic, close to the train station, and nice places to eat... Although we didn't meet Barney, we did meet Mary and she was lovely and she gave us some great suggestions for our stay. We also met some lovely fellow travellers staying at the house. The entire experience was fantastic and we would absolutely stay here again and would recommend them as well.",1
"Barney welcomed me as i arrived, the street was round the corner from a small river and lovely to sit and watch. The walk is about 10 minutes from the Tube station and is easy access into town. The hosts were very helpful with communication and sending me instructions. They also had information on tourism in Boston which was great as i went to Salem which i didn't consider doing before.",1
"This is a  clean, nice house in a cute neighborhood. However, I wish they had locks on their doors as many people stay here at one time and we had a theft issue here.",1
"I stayed in Barney's Master Bedroom with the Carney Family for a one day visit to Boston in September 2015. I was welcomed by Mary and was given a short tour of the rooms that were available to me. Furthermore, Barney and Mary were very helpful with their instructions before my stay, and the room and bathroom were very clean. And most important, the bed was very comfortable and helped me to sleep off the jet lag from my Transatlantic flight. If I return to Boston in the future, I would certainly consider staying there again!",1
"The house was lovely. I stayed in the Master Bedroom, which was very spacious with high ceilings and lots of windows. It was as clean as one would expect, and I arrived to a pitcher of water and instructions on the mantle on how to access WiFi, taxis, etc.

It was my first time sharing a washroom, and while it is not my personal preference to walk through a common area to get to one, there were no issues and it was available when I needed it.

I never actually met my host Barney, though he was incredibly helpful in our messages. He provided plenty of directions and was proactive in contacting me. I did briefly encounter Mary, who had a rather loud speaking voice, but who was very friendly.

I felt safe in the neighbourhood. It's about a ten minute, rather scenic, walk to the subway which took you just a few stops into Boston's downtown area.

I would recommend this listing.",1
"It was one of the most amazing rooms I've ever stayed in. Location was quiet but with superb access to city centre. Place was spacious. Totally clean. Barney is really friendly person and great host. His muffins were ready for us every morning and we wouldn't leave one! We loved the veranda, where you could sit and chill out. The living room where you sit and chill out. The beds where you could slouch and, well, chill out:-). We also made some great friends during our stay and were realy enjoying the time in Boston which was great deal thanks to Carney's family hospitality. ",1
The host was there to welcome us as we arrived about 8pm but they do work and are gone during the day. We felt safe walking in the neighborhood.   ,1
"The Carney's have a beautiful old home in a quiet residential neighborhood.  They are great communicators and made us feel welcome on our arrival as well as being available to us (but not intrusive) if we had any questions.  The home is very clean and convenient to the ""T"" subway system.  We walked to the JFK Library around Dorchester Bay and used the cab they recommended to get to the airport early in the morning.  They have incorporated many processes to make their guests visits work seamlessly and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  Thank you Mary and Barney.",1
Now I know why the hosts called themselves CarneyFamily: you don’t feel like a guest but like a long distance family member coming for a visit. You share the house with other long distance family members you haven’t met before what otherwise would happen only at weddings and funerals. I felt strange at the beginning being more used to hotels. Staying at the CarneyFamily couldn’t be more opposed and was exactly what I was looking for. The house may be a little bit tired around the edges but who cares when it is a home. It is very clean with a warm and welcoming as well a peaceful atmosphere. Thank you Mary and Barney for your hospitality and the delicious muffin for breakfast.,1
"The listing was accurate. The room was comfortable with a separate shared bathroom. The layout was a little unusual though as you had to walk through the shared kitchen / living area to reach the bathroom. The location was in a pretty suburb of Boston. Younger people might prefer to stay right in the bustle of the centre, but as we were travelling with a young child we weren't planning on late nights out. This location turned out well as it was considerably cheaper than staying in the centre but only a 20min train journey away from Boston Common in the centre. We didn't really see much of our hosts apart from a brief meeting.",1
"Barney made sure we found his place easily, and allowed us to park our car earlier on in the day, which was really appreciated.

The shower was nice and hot, and we were even able to get some laundry done while we were there.  The night was peaceful and quiet.  

The only concern we had was that the bedroom was right by the front door, and so we were able to easily here people leaving in the morning.  

Lovely breakfast and coffee was provided, which was another bonus.  We didn't get to meet the family, but the communication was always there. 

Overall a nice stay.",1
"The master bedroom at Barney's place was charming, clean and spacious. The place was fairly close to the train station and thus accessible. Barney was friendly and helpful. It was a little cold at night as there was no heat but was not a big problem, and I wish there was a key to the room as there were other guests sharing the place. ",1
"The location is great, very convenient. We enjoyed our stay very much! It's very comfortable, and the room is very big. The host provided many things for us to use, even the hand-made muffins! The host is really kind, making our trip in Boston more perfect! ",1
"Savin Hill is a wonderful location..nice neighborhood and comfortable getting around without a car. Walk along Harbor Walk was a real bonus... we enjoyed several times.
Subway to Boston and beyond very easy to navigate!
Mary and Barney are easy going and great hosts. Delicious muffins and granola a treat in the morning.
Rooms and kitchen are very clean all is well managed.
Must take time to visit JFK Library...very close.",1
The listing was accurate and we had a great stay during our trip to Boston,1
"The room was exactly as shown.  Very nice and a super comfortable bed.  It was great having access to a full kitchen (the one on the main floor is really only for guests) as we had fresh fruit, yogurt, and pancakes each morning that we made.  Barney and Mary were always available for help (either in person or by phone or text) and having a printer was very handy.  About a 5-8 minute walk to the Red Line (subway) with very easy access to downtown.  Thanks for a great stay !!


",1
"The place was very easy to get to via the train and the host provided thorough instructions for finding our room itself in their absence and remained very communicative over messaging before, during, and just after our stay (while we stored our luggage at the house to go exploring Boston after checking out but before our departing flight). 

This house is beautiful and old. Both Mary and Barney were sweet and informative. The coffee was excellent and the home was clean and relatively quiet aside from the few hours that Mary was humoring trick-or-treaters on the front porch :)",1
It is a really great experience to stay in Carney Family . Mary and Barney are really nice host. They are considerate and could think about every details about a guest such as there is not only hand wash but also hand wash lotion after you washing your hand. I enjoy every moment stay at the warm house:) I wish to come here again:),1
"We love the place, beautiful house nice area  to stay. Walking distant from train, not far from downtown and airport. Mary and Barney is very nice. At first we thought we had to catch a cab from airport to the house but Barney told us clear direction of how to travel to the house by train and it's free too. Also Barney bakes delicious muffin. You should try it!!! The best muffin I' ve ever had.",1
We were there shortly but Barney did come by first and second day made sure everything was good and that we had the amazing muffins in the am before or race! It was prefect a beautiful place and close to Boston. Definitely recommend and how to be back someday!,1
"I have spent awesome three days with this house and family. The house was clean and spacious more than I expected. Besides I could use facilities such as fridge shower include towel. Although this was my first time to use Airbnb, this family gave me detailed instruction. ",1
"This was a wonderful place to stay. The bed was incredibly comfortable and i had the best sleep. The warm is so warm and homey that i didn't want to leave. The hosts are great, making sure that the common areas are clean and homey. 
It didn't feel like i was staying at someones place, it felt like I was in a welcome home.",1
"Amazing room! Close to everything, nice and cozy house and great ambiance. Barney made everything easy for me before my arrival with detailed explanation of the Parking situation. I'll definitely come back my next time in Boston. ",1
"the house is big,have private bastroom,close to subway station.Barney is very nice,gave us many infomation around the house and Boston,will stay here again next time,thank you.",1
"It was the best bnb I've been. It is really like an American style home and very clean. The room was quite big.
It takes 7 minutes to the red line metro station by walk, and you can go lots of places with red line. You can eat some home-made bread and coffee, too. ",1
This was my first time staying in a Bed and Breakfast  and I have to say the bar is now set very high.  I felt very comfortable with all aspects of the home and my room.  The bathroom and shower and kitchen were all very clean.  Neighborhood is very quiet and I felt secure with parking my car on the street.  My wife had stayed here before and also had a very good experience.,1
"The room was very nice, cozy and spacious. I really like how the house was decorated. It makes me feel very comfortable. It is located in a nice and quite neighborhood with easy access to T. I highly recommend this place to people who travel in Boston. It is one of the best places I have ever stayed.  ",1
We loved Barney's master bedroom! It was very spacious and elegant. Muffins and granola were delicious. The house was only 10 minutes walking to red line. ,1
"I had a great time in Barney's Master Suite. The house is indeed in a charming section of Boston. I was only there for a quick overnight and ran into Barney and Mary briefly as they were heading out, but all the preparation (emails, texts, clean open space with coffee, tea, granola, sitting area) made me feel right at home. Hopefully I'll get to stay longer on a future visit!",1
"The neighbourhood is lovely. We enjoyed meeting Mary but never met Barney. Their home is beautiful. The Airbnb is like a hotel / hostel with lots of people coming through which was a bit much for us - especially late in the evenings. We loved the local architecture and the historic home. Nice generous touches such as shampoo and body wash, a coffee machine with good pods on our floor (3 floors of rooms),lovely muffins each morning. Juice if you get to it in time, and some apples. The house is on the red line subway which got us to Harvard, the centre, the aquarium and close to the Kennedy museum. Very handy. Lovely area and friendly and helpful locals. The home has a basketball ring which our children loved each morning!  There are cleaners almost daily so the share bathroom and kitchen are always clean. Thanks! ",1
The room was wonderful and clean. The kitchen was fully stocked for basic cooking. Muffins and granola were a great touch. Would recommend to anyone looking to stay in Dorchester. ,1
"Staying at the Carney Family's very well appointed Victorian B&B makes me want to come back to Dorchester/Boston, just to enjoy another stay at this lovely house in a great location.  Having been an innkeeper and B&B owner in southern Vermont for 7 years, this is how a B&B should be run for guests to have a memorable and positive experience.  Barney's Master Bedroom was so comfortable and spacious that I had a difficult time leaving today:) 

It was perfect for me as I appreciated the privacy of my bedroom, but the common area, including the living room and the well-stocked kitchen with delicious breakfast items. Mary's home-made granola and Barney's home-made breakfast muffins were most delicious.

Next time when I'll be in town for a conference, to visit Harvard University (since your place is conveniently on the red subway line stops), or just to enjoy Boston with family visiting from Germany, I 'll be sure to stay with you again.  Thank you for being such great hosts and providing such a nice accommodation for guests.",1
I am a frequent guest at the Carney's. Always a great stay. Great location and great rooms.,1
The house and room were really clean and cozy. Coffee machine was great. It was esay to communicate via airbnb app. ,1
"As always, a pleasure",1
Favorite spot,1
"Very excited ,more than amazing ",1
"Thank you both. What a warm and ""make yourself at home"" welcome. The friendliness you expressed to us and also freedom to come and go was perfect. 
Loved the granola and muffins. 
Pictures were just as it was. 
Thank you for the use of your sled too. 
Missed having more conversations or playing the piano more!!
Please come to Florida on us sometime soon!",1
Beautiful home and comfortable stay.  One of the most impressive airbnbs I've stayed at. ,1
Always my go to..,1
I stay at the Carney's on a weekly basis because of work & a long commute. Their home is warm & inviting. The rooms are comfortable & cozy. Makes my work week all the better.,1
It was great and the room was so nice also the view.,1
"This room was one of the coziest places I've ever stayed- spacious, with tons of light and warmth. The house itself was really great, not far from the train and nestled in a gorgeous neighborhood with two parks nearby. The muffins and granola are as tasty as advertised! If you're looking for an affordable place that's more than worth the money, you should stay here.",1
"We had a great experience staying at Mary and Barney’s place. While we never met our hosts, the house was beautiful and the room was perfect for the two of us. The kitchen was well-equipped and it was great to wake up to fresh muffins, coffee and granola each morning. The place was very close to the T train to get downtown. The view from the back porch was incredible. We could easily walk to the harbor and access the Harborwalk trail. We were well taken care of and will definitely be back!",1
"Very nice Airbnb, host is very welcoming and description is accurate. Excellent quality and price. Would highly recommend. ",1
"The house is gorgeous, and we have an amazing ocean view at third floor. Boston is the first stop of our spring break trip, and we have perfect two days in here. Mary and Barney are nice and very considerate. Thanks, I'm already looking forward our next meet. ",1
"The Carneys were simply amazing. They are super hosts for a reason. The directions were very clear re: how to get there and how to get in. The rooms, common areas, and bathroom were immaculate. The local area was very safe and quiet--only a short walk from the T. I would definitely stay with the Carney Family again!",1
"This is the first time we are using AirBnB. Very perfect experience! The owner was very welcoming, and very thoughtful. Bedroom、living room and kitchen、and restroom are all very tidy and clean. The location is very convinient. We will visit Boston a lot , we will always choose this place with no doubt. Thank you.",1
"Me and my friends stayed at the Carney Family's place for six days and had a wonderful time!
The house is beautiful, the city centre only a short walk and a quick ride with the tram away and Barney's muffins in the morning are really delicious. :)
Everything is as described, very clean and welcoming.
I very much recommend staying with these friendly hosts, enjoying hospitality, a gorgeous place and Boston itself of course.",1
"Had a lovely stay with the Carney Family. Very welcoming, and all rooms/kitchen/bathrooms were immaculately cleaned. LOVED the freshly baked muffins in the morning. The neighborhood was quiet and it was a very easy 5-7min walk to the nearest train station. ",1
"The house was amazing. This is a true BNB. 
Barney the host was fun to talk to. 
We share a beer and talked about, life, diet, and CrossFit. The room was gorgeous and comfortable.",1
The house is beautiful! Super close to the city and very accessible by public transportation. Barney is also incredibly friendly! The muffins were delicious! One of the top AirBnB experiences I've had,1
"I am a ""frequent flyer"" at the Carney's. The best place to stay in Boston.",1
I have the most amazing time staying at the Carney's place even now on my way back to canada I'm still talking about how good the place was. Thank you Barney and Mary for your kind hospitality. I will miss the muffin and smell of fresh flowers! I'm happy with everything also how close your place is to downtown it's so convenient! The house is always in a pristine condition. It was a pleasure staying there. Thank you so much. Love from jay,1
"Wonderfully clear directions for self check in to this awesome traditional Boston Victorian home. A very comfortable space- I felt very at home here - childhood memories of a similar large old home that I grew up in with its lovely tall ceilings, polished balustrades up to the top floor. And the self serve breakfasts were great. Fresh fruit, tea/coffee, homemade Granola and yoghurt and the homemade muffins of course! Great job Carneys! Very enjoyable stay!",1
My first AirBnB experience and it was a complete success. The muffins in the morning were delicious as was the yogurt orange juice and granola that was all provide! It was a quiet stay and every was as it was supposed to be. I would definitely stay here again.,1
"We enjoyed staying at Barney's house and felt like at home! The house was very clean, comfortable and convenient to everything. The room just as described. The muffins and the granola they make is so delicious. Mr Carney is a wonderful host, very kind and welcoming. Highly recommend others to stay here!",1
"I have stayed with the Carneys many times in the past, but this was my first time staying at Barney's Master Bedroom.  The bedroom is very comfortable and beautiful (there is even a fireplace in the room). Barney and Mary's home-made muffins and granola are delicious, and the house is a five-minute walk from the T-station in a residential Boston neighborhood. ",1
Stayed in this house for a week in the Master bedroom. The room itself had lots of room and a good sized double bed. House was beautiful and very relaxing. Loved the coffee and muffins in the morning. Very convenient to the T-Station as it was only about a 5 minute walk away. ,1
"Cosy and big room in a typical boston house.
Barney was very friendly and brought us very good muffins in the morning.
If you travel by car there is enought space to park.",1
It was awesome!! I liked the breakfast and bedroom. Also host was really kind. I had a great time in Boston and I want to visit there again.,1
Lovely 5-day stay at the Carney Family house. No problems and very clean. It's in a nice neighborhood and reasonable walking distance to the train station. ,1
We stayed again in another room which was perfect once again. The owner accompanied us for a late check out too which was a great convenience for my family.,1
"The host was very helpful and sent me all detail information before my check in.
The description is very accurate. the location is very convenient",1
Always wonderful.  This was my 4th stay and for my graduation. So close to transportation and a wonderful beautiful house,1
"Barney met U.S. and showed us around the entire house, including where they live. We were shown all the amenities and provided with advice on attractions, public transportation &a entertainment. The century plus house has so much character and is well maintained. The neighbourhood is very picturesque and quiet",1
"The house was really nice, and I really loved the muffins, granola, coffee, and etc. provided for us. The location was fairly close to the subway station so it was easy to get to the center of Boston and travel around. It was the best airbnb experience I had.",1
Had a wonderful 3 night stay with the Carney Family in Dorchester. Their home is so welcoming and full of old world charm. The location of this beautiful home is excellent close to the beach and train station and we could be in central boston within 15 minutes. The area was residential and we got a great feel for life in Boston. Barney and Mary are very hospitable and their breakfast muesli and muffins were amazing. They give full use of their laundry room which is a godsend when you are travelling. Would highly recommend this family and should we visit Boston in the future we will definitely stay there. Overall a wonderful experience,1
"We were welcomed with kindness. Super clean and cute. Accommodated our children well. Lots of extra touches with nice towels, robes and slippers, and water. Easy and convenient. Lovely setting near the water. ",1
It was a very nice stay. Would definitely recommend.,1
"Excellent stay, beautiful house and location.  We were barely there, staying for just one night, and spending much of our time in Boston.  The Carney Family was very friendly and accommodating.   
This will definitely be at the top of our list for any future stays in Boston.",1
"Another positive stay at the Carney family home. The ability to park my car, have use of a full kitchen , clean & comfortable room with AC and conveniently located close to Savin Hill red line station not to mention the friendly owners is the reason I'll continue to come back. ",1
Great room in a beautiful house in a nice neighborhood with easy access to Boston via the subway.  Would certainly stay again!!,1
"Beautiful and nice room in a beautiful home. Easy parking, acces to kitchen to cook. Graet breakfast, Cartney family was very friendly and well organized. All was perfect. We definitely recommend this place.
thanks ",1
"Barney's master bedroom is one of the rooms in his well equipped beautiful yellow house. The freestyle house rule impressed me deeply. Every door was unlocked and all guest are free to walk in and leave. Living with Barney in Dochester rather than central Boston is just great, if you want to avoid the crowd and tourist. I experienced the American neighborhood and also enjoy the every advantage in Boston by 20 mins with subway. In one word, I like it very much and I recommend it without hesitate. 非常干净,如果想体验美国人的社区生活,我很推荐!",1
"I only met Mary who was very friendly and welcoming. Great instructions were given prior to arrival and self check in was very easy.
The house has very good amenities and backs onto a beach and walkway. Easy walk to transport into the city - about 10 mins and cafe and bar.
Overall I would highly recommend if you don't want to be staying right in the city. ",1
"It has been a very pleasent stay. Mr. Carney has been very welcoming, explaining all needed things, he is an excellent host !",1
"Very nice house and owners, beautiful surrounding. Everything according ro photographs would go back if i could.",1
"It is a large and clean location, great place to visit Boston and meet other visitors. The breakfast is very good, especially the muffins who were delicious !",1
Our stay was great and our hosts were excellent,1
I can not find the words to express how wonderful our time was in Boston!  It was our first time and staying with the Carney's made our trip that much more enjoyable.  Barney and Mary were welcoming and wonderful hosts!  The home was beautiful and the neighborhood was wonderfully Bostonian!  We were a few steps from the beach and few blocks from the train that would take us into town.  We would absolutely stay again!,1
"Everything was clean, easy and friendly. We got all the information we needed beforehand and the Stay was very pleasent. With the subway its not that far from the center. ",1
"Barney's was the best Airbnb we ever stayed in. The house is situated at a very beautiful location and has a welcoming warmth to it. The hosts were responsive and very considerate of our needs. Super clean, quiet locality with greenery all around to make you feel at home. I'd love to stay here again on my next trip to Boston. ",1
"We had a great experience. It was a special treat to sit on the back porch, enjoying our tea and the evening breeze. It was as an experience as described. Lovely neighborhood, easy walking distance to the T. The communication with the host was very thorough and hospitable.
Would love to return on another trip.",1
"Heskel From Churchill Suite was very helpful and quick in response.  I was urgently trying to find an apartment in Boston during its high season in fall; most of the apartments in center of Boston from most agencies were all booked up. However, Heskel From Churchill finally managed to find one for us very quick which made us so relief.

The apartment was exactly what was described.  The location was superb, right in the center of Boston as what we were looking for; it took less than 5 minute walk to Copley Place and Prudential where we could find almost everything there -- foods, shopping, big supermarket near by, pick up spot for the Boston Duck Tour.  So close to Newsberry St. and Bolyston St. where one could find boutique shops, fine restaurants, IT shops and pharmacies; moreover, it's near T stations and taxi stand so we could get to anywhere.

Even though it was located in the city's center, the apartment had a private atmosphere in a quiet residential area-- no sound of traffics and community.   The apartment is spacious, clean and provided us with every things we would need such as clean towels, toiletries, extra blankets and pillows, strong wifi and kitchen utensils. There was an indoor parking space assigned for us upon our request; it's USD.40 per night.

We had a very pleasant stay and definitely will come back to rent the place again next time we visit Boston.",1
"Everything was just as described.  Great area, very close to everything--shopping, restaurants, etc. ",1
"We stayed at Churchill during a conference at the Marriott Copley place. It was everything we could have ever wanted: super clean rooms, a super well equipped kitchen, a washer and dryer and extra blankets and pillows. There was even a set of toiletries in the bathroom, which was great because I had forgotten my toothbrush. An added bonus was that our conference was a 30 second walk. The staff was super helpful and friendly. I can't recommend this place enough if you're thinking of going to Boston. It made our stay really memorable. Thanks for everything! ",1
"The apartment is managed by a company, so for the most part the check in and check out process was simple, but I wouldn't say there was anything to make me feel welcome. The apartment is as described and the pictures are mostly accurate. The neighborhood is lovely and very close to the Back Bay Station and the Hynes Convention center. 

Overall the apartment is as pictured, however it is not well maintained.  For example holes in the wall have been patched- but not painted over, the towel rack in the master bathroom was broken- small things like that. While not a big deal, for $570 a night I'd expect a bit more. Also you have until 11am to leave the apartment. At 10:30am on departure day, 2 maintenance guys came by claiming they needed to caulk around the shower. I said asked if they could come back a little later because I was getting dressed and finishing up. They seemed kind of insistent and as a single woman alone in the apartment- it made me feel uncomfortable. Luckily I wasn't around for much longer.  ",1
"This place is great. Its in a super neighborhood, close to shopping, Boston Commons, and more. The house is managed by a management company, and everything was good with that, but it doesn't have the same feel as a personal host. House is clean. It's a little barren (seems like a corporate apartment) but everything was clean and in order. ",1
"We had a great time in the Garrison Apartments. The location is great; you are in the hub of the city yet the apartment wasn't too noisy for they don't face the street. Its a nice and quiet apartment and the host made us feel welcomed by leaving thing we might need immediately at arrival at our disposition. The listing description was accurate and you could not ask for a better neighborhood.
What I would have liked though if for a better equipped kitchen, specially since it was a one month stay where we wished to cook for ourselves rather than going out every day. (For people who stay just a few days it shouldn't be an issue.) There were no toppers, no pirex's, nor serving/cooking utensils. ",1
"Great location, great apartment! Fit all of our needs. Move in instructions were clear and comprehensive! Will stay again!",1
"The apartment was even better than I expected. Everything I needed was provided in there. The location is perfect too. A beautiful, cozy, 2-bedroom apartment at probably one of the best locations in Boston with an affordable price? What can I ask for more? I'm feeling very lucky and happy to have chosen this place for a stay.",1
This was a nice place.  Basicly across the street from the convention center.  I would recommend this place over the nearby hotels any day.,1
"Mike was very nice, available and flexible upon my inquieries. The checkin information and procedure is very precise and easy to follow. It is a very good location; the neighborhood is beautiful, calm and pretty close from everything by walk (restaurants, bars, other neighborhoods). 

The only downsides are:
1- thought we would have the apartment for wich I had read the listing, for wich I inquired about, and for wich I made the reservation, but it was not. The description said there were a fireplace, 2 double beds and 1 sofa bed, and that was perfect for us since we were two couple and one single person. I even inquired especially about the bed for the fifth person, so I expected to have the appropriate beddings. Finally, the apartment we had, had no fireplace, and only 1 double bed, but 2 single beds and 1 single bed in the footrest (not a sofa bed) wich was not confortable at all for the fifth person. Plus, there was extra single bed sheets, but no cover for the fifth guest. We made the best of this situation, but for 3 people out of 5, the bedding arrangement was not very confortable; and that was not what was expected according to the price we paid...

2- To my opinion, it would really help visitors if the parking information and procedure were added to the listing. We were told parking was available on premises, for a price, and that all could be arranged at the concierge desk. Upon arrival, we learned that the payment was only possible with a check or a money order, wich you don't always have on you when you travel... Let's just say it is not very convenient as payment method, but if we had known, we would have been prepared and we would'nt have been through all that trouble just to park the car.

Despite those 2 downsides, we had a really great trip and the apartment fitted our needs about everything else!",1
"This apartment is in a terrific location in Back Bay: short walk to Back Bay station, Copley and Prudential centre.  The apartment is in a complex of modern, secure and well kept apartments.  Very comfortable and well appointed: exactly as described.  Check in and out was easy and Mike was very communicative and helpful.  I would definitely stay here again.  Wonderful.",1
"Mike was very easy to get in contact with and very helpful with any questions. The location was ideal, and is within walking distance of many attractions/restaurants/shopping that Boston has to offer. The apartment itself was very clean, spacious, and the amenity baskets provided were a nice touch. Although the apartment we stayed in was not the exact apartment shown in the pictures, it was very similar. I would definitely recommend staying here to anyone else looking to visit Boston. ",1
"We stayed in this apartment for 9 days. It was a central location and we walked everywhere.  Our apartment faced an inner courtyeard and that made it very quiet from street sounds. 
The apartment was clean, spacious with lots of closets.  
It made for a perfect home for our stay. ",1
"The apartment was fairly clean. The building itself and the apartment complex was very nice and the staff of the complex were also very helpful. There was no contact with the host, but there were very clear and specific directions regarding check-in and check-out. There were very lovely and useful ""gift bags"" for both kitchen and bathroom use, which was a nice touch. The location was great! Wish there had been free parking, but the garage under the building was very convenient",1
"I didn't speak with Mike at all.  The directions provided before our visit covered everything we needed.  The location is more of a corporate housing situation.  Great for our family of 5.  We did not have the unit in the pictures but our apartment had the same layout.  Our unit appeared a little more... dated than the pictures.  

The good:
Centrally located to just about everything you'd want to visit in Boston.  Every uber ride was less than $20.
Walking distance to a grocery store.
Clean apartment when we arrived.  Everything worked well enough (shower had water pressure, washer and dryer okay, oven and microwave worked, etc.)
Safe neighborhood.
Quite building, couldn't hear anyone else.

Could be improved:
The building is an older building and it shows.  There were small issues that you wouldn't want to have to deal with during a shorter stay.  For example: the door to the bathroom in the master bedroom wouldn't close because the hinge had fallen.  The toilets didn't flush well.  The caulk in the shower had come off.  The unit looked like it needed a handyman to spend a day there fixing little odds and ends.  There was supposed to be a security guard at the entrance who we saw twice in the 6 days we were there.

Overall a good experience for us and it accomplished what we needed.  Would I recommend this rental? Yes.  Would I use it again? Probably not.
",1
"The unit provided was not similar to the pictures posted during our reservation including one less bathroom, no outdoor patio and not properly functioning Internet and tv.  The overall unit quality was significantly less than the one we believed we reserved.  No real assistance from the local Management Staff and the Host did not respond to multiple requests for assistance.  We were however assisted by a very skilled, friendly and generally wonderful Airbnb Help Desk Representative.  Our desire to continue to utilize Airbnb was saved by her professionalism and continued support.  We should have been warned regarding the unit change by the Host prior to arriving allowing us to decide to stay or seek others choices.  At the price of this unit it should have at least met or exceeded our expectations which it did neither.  Thank you Airbnb Staff for properly resolving this for us.",0
"This is a great spot to experience the Back Bay and South End. It's a super convenient apartment to shopping, food and the city overall.  The apartment is quite functional and very secure.  The concierge was always quite friendly as well.  There were nice toiletry packs, lots of clean towels and some basic paper goods and household items along with a fully equipped kitchen (pots, pans, utensils, etc...)",1
"Small but perfectly formed and in a great area.  I was travellng alone, working in Boston for the week and found it met all of my needs. Close to the convention centre, a block away from restaurant row, there's a 7-11 close by and wine store next door. The apartment is compact, really well maintained and as I said, met my needs. ",1
"The place is near a subway station and a bus stop, which is great. It locates at the very center of the city so you get lots of shops and restaurants in walk distance. The concierge took  care of everything so we didn't meet the host in person. There was only one bed in the house but with a sofa bed, we actually fitted in 4 people. Everything was fine and we had a great time in Boston. ",1
"Perfect location, close to convention centre. The apartment is almost brand new, and very clean. I actually didn't have any contact with Adam, the host, but all contact went through an official agency (which owns numerous service-apartments throughout town). Would come back.",1
"Really great location, super central! Adam answers as soon as possible and is super attentive to any questions you might have. The staff is also great!",1
"This is a very nice almost brand-new apartment in Boston's Back Bay, close to the Berklee College of Music and Fenway Park. It's on the 2nd floor and it has a view of the nearby Mass Turnpike and a commuter rail line, as well as buildings beyond those.

Overall, it was a good price (for Boston!) and had just about everything we needed. ",1
"The checkin procedure was very smooth and quick,the apartment was  just as described ,very well equipped and clean .Excellent location with all essentials available near by around the clock.Taxi stand, train station,bus stop all within walking distance.Concierge was very helpful and informative. Altogether we had  an excellent experience during our stay. Thank you Adam and the rest of the staff.",1
"Pros: 
LOCATION - walking distance to Fenway, and Green line. 
Easy food access (restaurants all over)
Cleanliness
Professionalism 
Easy check in and check out 
Friendly concierge 
Snacks and water bottles provided
Map and little tour brochures also provided
Wonderful experience


Cons: 
Small bed",1
"I had a great experience with my 1st Airbnb experience at this Compass apartment at 1085 Boylston St., Boston. During booking, Adam answered to my inquiries very promptly. The check in process was smooth & easy, and the staff whose name is Cristiane is very friendly & helpful. I stayed there for 10 days with my son after his knee surgery for recovery, we stayed inside the apartment most of the time and it feels like home. The apartment was very clean and neat like new when we checked in. The furniture, bedding, and utilities in the kitchen and bathroom are all very new. There is a TV in the living room and the bedroom, which comes with cable and a DVD player. Iron & ironing board, vacuum cleaner & hair dryer are provided too. The bed was fairly comfortable, however since it is beside a highway, you do hear cars and trains passing by; it didn’t bother me and my son, but it might be a slight problem if you are an extremely light sleeper. The bathroom came with everything needed including towels, shampoo & soaps. The kitchen utilities provided are definitely enough to cook most meals. They are very thoughtful to provide kitchen towel, washing sponge, washing soap & dishwasher detergent. There are multiple washing machines and dryers in the building for use. Overall the apartment felt very homey and has everything you need to live in for long periods of time. I parked my car in the basement parking lot with a $20/day fee, a good deal! The location is great! There are plenty restaurants right across the street, and more with a 5 to 10 minute walk down Boylston or Newbury Street, Prudential Center is 10 minutes away. Supermarket & pharmacies are all within walking distance.

To conclude: Great location! Extremely homey, and has everything you need. But it might take a day or two to get used to the noises from the cars and trains on the highway outside.
",1
Host provided great information upfront to help prepare for checkin. Apartment was lovely. Great location. ,1
Nice location in Boston. Everything was as described on the website. Our flight was delayed and the concierge stayed past midnight to let us in.....much appreciated. Would definitely stay there again on my next trip to Boston!,1
"Location, location, location. This describes both the good and the bad about this apartment. The good is that the apartment is conveniently within walking distance to plenty of restaurants, Fenway Park, Newbury Street, Hynes Convention Center, and subway station. We liked how late-night food options were right across the street. The bad about the location is that it's situated right next to the highway and train tracks. Our particular unit, #104, was on the first floor directly facing the highway and tracks (not overlooking lively Boylston Street as seen in the description photos). The cars passing on the highway were not that bothersome but the sound of the train and its vibrations were. In fact it woke up our 10-month old baby each time it passed during the night because the rumble could be felt. Perhaps higher units or units facing the street do not have this problem. If I had known, I would've definitely requested a different unit. That problem aside, everything else was fine. The place was clean and well-stocked, although a few extra towels and back-up toilet paper roll would be nice. We received one roll for the 3 of us for a one week stay. The concierge did give us additional rolls when requested, but it's kind of inconvenient when you find out there's no backup when you need one the most. Free laundry and detergent was a nice touch. Concierge was extremely nice and helpful. I would stay at this apartment again, but would probably ask for a different unit. ",1
"This was such a great surprise and find.  My son and I were planning on a trip to Boston to see the Red Sox and Yankees play...after looking for hotels I was shocked out how expensive they were.  A friend had told me about Airbnb - at first I was skeptical - staying in others homes was a bit uncomfortable.  The surprise for us was that it was better than a hotel, clean, GREAT location (an easy walk to Fenway), near great shopping and restaurants, the staff was very  helpful and friendly...and of course Adam was extremely responsive.  I would definitely stay at this property again - I travel a lot and will definitely use this serve in the future....",1
"Edwin really made me happy to stay his place. I did very late request to stay his place and had to arrive at his place at late night, however, he took care of what I needed to have while my stay in his place.
I was not really a good guest though what he had treated me was so wonderful. Lot of recommendation!",1
"Enjoyed the flexible check in&out and the parking spot. Studio is perfect for a stay overnight after a long flight, if you want some privacy. Gavin is always available, just text him, if you have questions. Had a really nice chat. Looking forward to come back in summer to try out the walk to the beach.",1
"Great place, Good Price! Close to the Subway, easy commute into city! ",1
Gavin's studio was great! The room had everything we needed. It was very clean. Did not have a problem with noise and his instructions for everything were right on point. A+,1
we stayed at gavin's apartment for two nights. check in/out and communication was uncomplicated. apartment is very close to the subway and the airport. it was a nice experience. ,1
Great stay. The loft had everything we needed. Location is great for anyone who wants a quick access to Downtown Boston. There are friendly food markets around to buy anything you need. The internet didn't work at first but Gavin took care of it quickly. Loft was as described and clean. Thank you for the flexible check out process. We recommend this loft to anyone!,1
Listing was accurate and thorough. Gavin was very helpful. Location was perfect to get to/from the airport easily.,1
"Our stay at Gavin's studio was excellent.  All as described in the listing and I would even say that the location to the Train station is even closer than listed! Very convenient to get in and out of Boston down town.
Check in/out was straightforward and convenient and parking was easy.
Would definitely recommend to friends/family visiting the area.
We did not really check out the neighbourhood so can't comment on that.",1
"Just great and all you need! Very, very clean apartment! Perfect location to downtown Boston, beach close too! Gavin is a great host, Checkin and checkout easy and uncomplicated. He replys fast and can give your tips about beantown! 
Always a stay worth it! ",1
"Listing is very accurate, it was easy to get to and get around Boston as it is right across the street from the subway. The apartment was very clean and tidy. Never met Gavin but he was very helpful and easy to reach by text and email, with quick replies. We would stay here again for sure. ",1
Room was great adn as advertised. Loved staying on our old neighborhood with some of our favorite restaurants and super easy access to T. Gavin was easy to communicate with and check in/out process was super easy. ,1
"Gavin's spot is perfect for what we needed.  Free parking, close to some key shopping spots, and right next to a transit station that gets you into downtown Boston in fewer than 15 minutes.  The apartment is exactly what you want if you're out and about a lot, but it has what you need to settle in for the night too.  The air conditioner was much appreciated.  Gavin was easy to contact and left all the info we needed.  And the beach!  Only a 10 minute walk away, and the perfect spot to relax.  We loved it!",1
"Studio was well situated, easy access to highway and Downtown Boston. Check in and out was easy. Good place to stay at reasonable price. Gavin was helpful and available if needed.",1
"This was a great listing, very affordable for such a great location. Gavin made it easy for us to check in/out, as we were driving and unsure of what time we would be arriving and departing. The apartment had all of the essentials and was very clean.",1
"My husband and I had a wonderful four-night stay at Gavin's studio apt by the airport. It was exactly as pictured and Gavin was great about communication and making sure when knew how to find the apt. We LOVED being so close to a blue line stop. It was no trouble at all getting to/from the airport or to/from Boston central and I highly recommend the neighborhood. There's a delicious Colombian restaurant, El Paisa, just up the street, and the local Dunkin' Donuts was great for grabbing a quick breakfast before heading out for some site-seeing. The wifi, tv, and air conditioning all worked great and there was laundry in the building had we needed it. The apt was clean and comfortable! 

I considered giving this listing four stars instead of five, only because the bathroom is a bit outdated in how it looks, but ultimately, the pros far outweighed the cons. The bathroom worked fine and the location and cost are hard to beat. Highly recommend!",1
Place is exactly as described. Loved the location. Would stay here again and again. WIFI was slow but that was easily remedied by longing into a stronger unprotected signal.  ,0
"This apartment is ideally located in front of the Orient height station. It is really clean and the parking is a real plus. Check in and check out was very easy.
Gavin was very helpful, responding very quickly to all messages and allowing us to leave the car few more hours before taking our plane on our last day.
We really recommend this place! 
",1
The apartment is located very closed to T and City center is only few stops.  The apartment is exactly as described.  Gavin was extremely responsive to my questions.  Overall I had a pleasant stay.,1
"I really enjoyed my stay at this apartment!  Everything about the listing was accurate, and the neighborhood was nice and felt safe and was really close to a waterfront park which was a good place to go jogging.  Super convenient as well, being so close to the train station, and was only a $20 cab ride back from downtown after the trains stopped running.   It wasn't right in the heart of a touristy or trendy area but that's what I liked about it!",1
"The apartment was great, exactly as pictured. The location right across from a blue line stop makes it worth your while. The air conditioner worked well and the shower had long lasting hot water. This is the perfect stay for anyone looking for easy access to all things downtown Boston for a great deal. Gavin was also the friendliest of hosts and answered any questions I had making the stay easy and comforting. ",1
"I really feel lucky staying at Gavin’s place. The descriptions and photographs of his place are exactly what you see online here. For two people staying at this place it was super cozy and in the perfect location. Check in and check out was great. Our time was spent mainly in downtown Boston and this place is literally right across the street from the train station. Very simple hop on to the transit and we were set to go! Gavin was great, answered any questions I had and always responded quickly. We checked in before and after the trip. This place has everything you need and was super clean!!",1
"Gavin's place was perfect! just what I was looking for. Pictures are accurate as how the place looks. Location is minutes from the airport and train is just across the street. Various food restaurants nearby, walking distance, definitely recommend El Paisa, which is right around the corner. Beach is close by as well. Gavin was great in responding to my questions immediately.  This was my first time using airbnb and visiting Boston, could not have asked for a better experience! Would Definitely consider staying here again.",1
The studio is in a nice neighborhood and extremely conveniently located right across the Blue line which takes you to the airport and downtown in just minutes. The studio is clean and perfect for my business trip in Boston. Gavin was very helpful and responsive to my inquiries. ,1
"Gavin was very accessible and low-key, which was great... The apt was in a perfect location-directly across from the train!  Rite-Aid, Dunkin' Donuts, Burger King and Subway were minutes away walking distance!  Apt was very clean and  I would recommend the location absolutely!",1
"Apartment was very nice, cozy and clean. Location was extremely convenient, right next to the subway blue line allowing an easy and quick transit to Boston. Gavin was helpful and easy to reach during our stay. Thanks a lot! :)",1
"Check-in and checking out were super easy. The listing was exactly as described and the best part was the convenient location across the T station! We only wish that the internet wasn't as spotty and that there was an iron available, but other than that we enjoyed our stay. We would definitely consider staying here again!",1
Gavin's place was excellent. It was always at an adequate temperature. The free parking was great and being able to walk right to public transportation made our time getting to know Boston a breeze. He had clear instructions and was available at a moments notice if we had any questions. The apartment was also super clean!,1
"Perfect place, perfect location near the train station. Quiet neighborhood. Very clean studio. I strongly recommend this place!! ",1
"Great location really near the train station. Clean studio. The laundry is right next door to the studio (there was a Little background noise).
Check-in and check-out were easy.
Gavin was helpful and easy to reach during our stay.
I strongly recommend this place!
I would definitely consider staying here again.",1
"Awesome place! Literally right across from the T-Station allowing us to get to down town hot spots in about 10-15 minutes. Also right up the street from a Rite-Aid, Dunkin Doughnuts, and a few other little restaurants and grocery stores. Very clean and comfortable room. Equipped with all the amenities you'd need. The neighborhood and apartment both felt very safe. Minor background noise from other residence, but nothing major. Not super big, but holds two very comfortably. I would highly recommend this place!",1
Host was readily available at checkin. The place was clean but furniture and appliances were worn and the TV didn't work very well though the Wifi worked just fine.  Parking was right outside and always available.  ,1
"This was a great little studio next to the T station. We stayed for 6 days and 5 nights. Gavin was super accommodating with our check in time, and everything was very clean and well stocked. I highly suggest using the T to travel to and from the airport; we had an issue with a cab driver who got lost and charged us $40 even though it's only two stops on the T from the airport - all because we didn't realize we needed to specify ""East Boston"" as our location. We have zero complaints about Gavin or this listing and would highly recommend. ",1
The description of the space was as disclosed. The convenience of being near the T is an asset as well as proximity to the downtown.,1
The apartment was perfect for what we needed for our stay in Boston. It was just big enough for two people. The location was great because it was literally right across from the T station. The walls seemed a little thin because we could hear our neighbors but the noise wasn't enough to keep us awake at night. Gavin was flexible and easy to work with. We had a great time exploring Boston!!,1
"A cozy place near the tube that lives up to the images and description shared as part of the brief on Airbnb. What made the place unique were the small details and things that Gavin did, like the munchies in the refrigerator, he was also flexible with the checkout timing which was an added bonus. Detailed and prompt responses made our stay comfortable and would highly recommend to anyone visiting Boston for the first time, thank you!",1
"Excellent value. Safe, fully-furnished, clean place across from the T station (5 min to airport, 10 min to downtown). Check in/out process was very easy. Gavin was flexible with our travel arrangements and adjusted check in/out time accordingly. Place is as described - small, cozy, adequate for cleaning up and getting a good night's sleep before starting another day full of adventure. It isn't a place I'd like to stay and hang out/relax all day due to its size and TV that appeared to be antenna/not cable, but it more than suited our needs. ",1
Wonderful stay ,1
"The listing was exactly as described and as it appeared. Extremely convenient location to the city by train and easy to travel to/from by car. Included parking pass was a bonus and free wifi could be used around other city hotspots, too.

All in all, my sister and I had a great (albeit, too short) time!",1
"Gavins apartment was exactly as described and the location as well as the key were very easy to find. We did not meet him in person, but he was always reachable and answered quickly. The connection to Downtown Boston was perfect with the train station located directly on the other side of the street. Unfortunately the TV did not work very well and there was no real supermarket in walking distance (only some small food stores which were pretty expensive). But these are just some small remarks, overall we enjoyed our stay very much and would come back anytime!",1
"The good: wonderful location right across from the train station, nice neighborhood, listing is as it says, toiletries and other random items are in the bathroom for use, host responds in a timely manner, cheap parking at train station across the street ($5 a day)

The not so good: don't plan on watching any TV. There are limited channels and even those cut in and out every few seconds. There is no cell phone service in the studio and the WiFi wasn't working for half my stay (though I will say Gavin was very accommodating in trying to get that up and running), the shower drainage is poor and there ends up being a pool of water by the end, there was little spots of mold on the shower curtain, no free street parking except on weekends

All in all, I would not stay here again. One part of the listing was inaccurate and I thought I would have a parking pass and didn't. The first day I got there I spent a half hour in rush hour traffic trying to find a spot, but it was all resident parking or for limited time. The host was attentive but there were too many things that need to be improved. ",0
"Nice and clean apartment literally across the street from public transportation and a small beach. Gavin was very prompt about providing us with the information needed to check in, which is always appreciated. We definitely enjoyed our stay in Boston!",1
Gavin was a really good hpst,1
"The listing was just as described and the location was wonderful!  Gavin was very accomadating with the check in and out times.  I thought it was weird that there was food in the fridge and cupboards, but to each their own.  I would stay there again!  ",1
"The apartment was clean and as described, but the photos are misleading. It's a small apartment in a lower end of town. While nothing happened, the apartment doesn't feel like the safest that we could have rented in that area. I was thankful to have the hubby there with me, otherwise I would have reconsidered. 

Overall, if you're looking for a cheap place to stay, this place is great. You can spend a week there and not break the bank. And it's clean, so that's a plus. ",1
"Great apartment! Everything was as described in the (URL HIDDEN) issues found whatsoever. 

Great location in terms of convenience to the train station, dunkin donuts! ",1
"The apartment is private, clean, and comfortable. Gavin is a great host, all around a good experience!",1
"Amazing apartment with great views. Everyone in the building was very nice and helpful. I was in Boston for work, so I didn't spend much time in the apartment, but I wish I could use swimming pool or spend some time on a balcony with gorgeous views!",1
"Very beautifull appartment with a great view of boston, there is a book with details to enjoy the town. Richard is a good and very reactive host",1
"We were thrilled when we arrived at the (URL HIDDEN) was exactly how Richard described it.  It was spotless, a great size for the 3 of us and very comfortable.  

On a related note:  the building consierege upon arrival was lovely.  Very personable and helpful.

Overall, this was a fantastic experience and I would recommend Richard's place to anyone.",1
"This is a great apartment, with spacious rooms, great views, and a great location. We came on a college visit trip and found this apartment to be a perfect home base for the Boston schools we visited. We walked to the New England Aquarium, nice italian restaurants in the North End, and close by subway access allowed us to get to the Museum of Fine Arts easily. The apartment itself was spotlessly clean and well stocked with high quality pots and pans, good kitchen knives, flatware, linens, comfy beds (one a fold out couch that worked fine for our two high schoolers); there were even a couple of bottles of wine waiting for us when we arrived! The WiFi, cable TV, workout gym, and on site parking only added to the experience. Even the shower was great - strong and hot! All communications with Richard were smooth and prompt, and we have no complaints. We would love to stay again if we're in the Boston area.",1
"Where to start?! You walk in and the place takes your breath away. Amazing views and so clean! Very comfortable furniture and so much room. The location was perfect and just a five minute walk to Fanuiel Hall. Richard was very easy to get a hold of and the directions were very easy to follow. If I go back to Boston, which I will, because the city has so much to offer, I will be back at one of Richard's places!",1
"While Alex is a great photographer, the pictures do not do the apartment justice; the high ceilings and natural light made this a great place to stay. It was very convenient to stores and restaurants on Newbury Street, and close to Copley Place and the Prudential Center as well. Ultimately we were in town for a couple of games at Fenway and it only took 20 minutes and two stops on the T to get there - very easy!

Alex was great to coordinate with and very easy to reach. Couldn't have asked for a better place to stay for the weekend.",1
A very airy and open apartment that has a very inviting feel that makes you feel at home.  This studio is in the perfect location for accessing all that Boston has to offer.  Picturesque Back Bay brownstone on a tree-lined street and close to everything.  Wonderful walking paths in the area as well.  Host was easy to communicate with and very responsive with a last minute reservation - much appreciated!,1
"Listing was exactly as pictured. Perfect for myself and 2 friends. Location was great. We either took an uber or walked. It was in walking distance of Newbury street where there were a ton of cute little shops and restaurants. Alex was extremely accommodating and helping from booking, to our check out. Would definitely stay here again sometime in the near future.",1
Checking in and out was very easy. Studio is very well located.,1
"Alex's studio is great located in Boston. You are walking distance from the key places. The studio is stylish, confortable and spacious. Great place!",1
"Alex's apartment in the Back Bay is fantastic! Beautifully appointed, super clean and extremely convenient to all the major attractions in the city. Alex is also an extremely helpful and responsive host.

If you're looking for a great Back Bay pad from which to explore the city, look no further!",1
"Alex's apartment is set up very nicely. We were two women traveling and it was nice to have the separate bed and futon. Easy access, great location (walkable to many places), plenty of character and light. We would stay again. Alex was helpful (by text) and timely in answering questions. Altogether a comfortable and easy stay in Boston.",1
"Alex was a wonderful host! His studio is inviting, very clean, and convienient to the great points of attraction in Boston. Boston Commons took 5 minutes for us to walk to, North End attractions were only 1.5 miles away, and they too were easily walkable. The neighborhood this gem is located in is very beautiful and rich in history. I would definitely recommend staying here! Thank you, Alex!",1
A very clean apartment in one of the best locations in Boston.  I would definitely stay here again.,1
"This was everything I was hoping for.  The space was so chic and cozy.  The location was perfect for all of our activities - from fine dining to sightseeing!  I cannot recommend this place enough.  Plus, the bed was SUPER cozy and I really never wanted to leave! ",1
I am so sorry about commenting so late. Jason is a very nice guy. My wife and her friend live for one night. They both felt very comfortable. His house is near downtown and the red line. This is very convenient. ,1
"As first time user of airbnb I wasn’t sure what to expect.  Fortunately, I was lucky to stay with Jason.  He is a great host, very considerate and always on the lookout for the small details that makes this whole experience a pleasant one.

His apartment is at a short walk from the T so getting around Boston is very easy and convenient.  The bedroom was awesome, incredible space and a great closet.  The neighborhood very quiet so getting a good night sleep is guaranteed.

I will stay again at Jason’s without a doubt.

"Loved it. Far better than I expected. This was my first airbnb stay and I did not expect it to be so great. Jason is a warm and fun person to hang out with and he is also a cleanliness freak :) The room and bed were comfortable and it's a nice ,quiet and a very safe  neighborhood. 

Jason went out of the way to make sure I was comfortable. I will definitely stay here the next time I visit Boston. ",1
"Jason was very welcome, kind, and accommodating.  The room was actually larger than the pictures make it look and it was in a great location as well. I would recommend staying with Jason.",1
"stay in Jason´s house was excelent. house was clean, comfortble and near to Boston Downtown. Jason is a good person and great host. I enjoyed my stay in his house.",1
"I've had some great hosts on Airbnb, but Jason was one of the best! He made sure to be home when I arrived and showed me around the apartment. Jason is great and it was fun to have some conversation with him. He was also very accessible via text all the time. 

As for the apartment itself, it is extremely clean, well decorated/furnished, and very comfortable. The bedroom is actually bigger than it looks in the pictures and I had plenty of space. I didn't have much time to use the kitchen, but it was nice and available if I had wanted to. 

Jason lives in a great area that was super convenient to get to anywhere in Boston using public transit. I did bring a car and parking got a little tricky, but only because there was some repaving happening on the road the day I was there. 

HIGHLY recommend staying with Jason when you are in Boston, I know I'll be back next time I am in town!",1
"Jason had made good preparations and gave us before arrival detailet information how to reach his place. He was able to answer all our questions and he was relly helpful. Though we were only two day it was better for us to take a seven day pass for local transportation. Everything was, what you expect and hope to have. Surrounding safe. Local transport near. Informationmaterial availabe. I would make another stay, if going to Boston again.",1
Jason's room was a great place to crash. The bed was comfy and the room spacious. The apartment is close to the metro station and there are a couple of good places to eat nearby. I only met Jason briefly but he was really helpful and we had an interesting conversation. Would definitely recommend.,1
"The best host on Ab&b.

The place is always clean and peaceful. Jason is very welcoming. Will stay with him on future opportunities.
",1
"Jason is a very great host and make us feel comfortable in his house. He gave good tips about the town and his neighborhood . His house is so tidy and clean, near the subway station ( 10 min to go to the city center ). 
Plus, facilities are so close to the house ( super market, fast food and other stuff ). ",1
"I had a great stay at Jason's place! The room was very clean and comfortable, and the building was quiet. It felt like home. There is a subway stop nearby (5-10 minute walk), and from there you can get to anywhere in the city. Plenty of restaurants, bars, and corner stores in the area too. Jason was friendly and an overall great host.  I highly recommend his place and I'd definitely stay there again.",1
Great host. Exactly as described.,1
"Great host, good communication, great welcome and good location close to the 'T' (train for those that don't know) which was handy for heading into the centre.
Upon arrival Jason offered ideas for things to see places to eat which was needed as I knew nothing of Boston.  
Pizza, 'Jim B' and good conversation were great extras after a day of traveling.
Highly recommend future guests to stay there at Jason's.
Cheers
",1
"Great experience. Met Jason on the first day, very late at night. I couldn't find parking and he woke up to go out with me to show me where I can park. Great host, awesome place, and great area. Will definitely stay here again next time I come to Boston!",1
Jason was great with us! He told us about places we should visit and bars to have a drink. He was realy warm! We felt really comfortable in his apartment and had a great time there.,1
"The apto is always clean, great temperature and Jason is the most wonderfull host.",1
"Hosts like Jason are the reason why Ab&b will be successfull.  He takes care of all the details, makes you feel like home and is always available when you need help.

I will stay at his place everytime I need to be in Boston.",1
"Great apartment, great host, great stay.  Jason was extremely accommodating and helpful, and I had everything I needed!  Well done!",1
"Great host, apartment is nice and clean and the area is very safe and close to downtown",1
"This was my first Air BnB experience, and if Jason's hospitality is any indicator of the professionalism and attention to detail, then I will be using Air BnB in every city I visit. His room was exactly as described, the air mattress was fantastically comfortable. He keeps a very clean apartment, and respects the privacy of his guests. I was in town on business for 5 days and the stay made the trip very manageable. His directions to the place were spot on and he was available for any questions I had. Arriving late on the first night, he was willing to accommodate my arrival with the utmost of care and ease. Being my first experience, it was a pleasure to meet him and hear about his travels. If you are ever in Boston and his rooms are available, do yourself a favor and book with Jason, he treats AirBnB as a business with the personal touches of simply being a guest in his home. A+!",1
Jason was a great host!!!  He met me upon my arrival and immediately made me feel at home.  The room was clean.  Bed was comfortable.  I found neighborhood to be safe.  I would definitely recommend Jason.,1
"Everything Jason posted about his place in Boston was 100%. Everything was where he said it was and I felt right at home. Coffee, tea and bottled water were all supplied. The nearest tram station was a short 5 minutes walk away and only three stops from the heart of Boston.

Everything was clean and tidy. I thought I was the only one there.",1
"Jason was great. He helped us with maps of boston and a first orientation in the city. The room was very clean and quiet in a beautiful appartment. We could use his kitchen, too. Metro and supermarkets are just around the corner. Perfect spot to discover boston!",1
"Jason was a very gracious host. He was able to meet me when I arrived and even installed an air-conditioner in the room I stayed in to deal with the heat. It made the room very comfortable. Our interaction was brief as I was busy attending a conference the entire stay, but he was very kind and eager to provide any assistance needed. A+",1
Jason was a great host. Description of the property was spot on and overall it was a great stay. ,1
I have enjoyed my stay. Very easy access location. Very clean and friendly host. Very friendly and nice and very quick in response!!,1
"Jason's apartment was located in a great area and close to the subway. The neighbourhood was quiet but also close to the centre of town. The apartment was clean and tidy, and the room was very spacious. Jason is an awesome host. We met him very briefly and he was very helpful. I definitely recommend staying at Jason's apartment.",1
"Jason was a perfect host in every possible way. He was warm, welcoming, and respectful. His place is clean and organized. I felt home from day one. I'd recommend him to every traveler without any reservation. Thanks, Jason!",1
"It was rhe first time that we've booked an airbnb and I was great! Lovely home, Jason was a great host and gave us a lot of information about the city. I certainely recommed the place! ",1
"Everything worked perfect
Thanks a lot",1
"Jason's place is lovely and clean and as described. He was a great host and made me feel welcome, even taking me out with his friends one night. Definitely would recommend staying with Jason if you're in Boston. He was very helpful and knowledgeable about the city ",1
"Jason was very communicative and accommodating during our overnight at his apartment this 4th of July weekend. His place is very clean and comfortable, and minutes from the Andrew Square station that gets you into Downtown Boston. Every question I had was answered right away, and I felt safe in our private room. ",1
Jason was an excellent host. I booked for a sofa bed but he let me stay in another room with a real bed because it was available. I really appreciate it. The place was tidy and spacious. The location is perfect since it's very close to the train station. :),1
Very welcoming gave great tips on where to go out.,1
"Jason' apartment was immaculately clean and organized.  We had some misunderstanding about the nature of the rental and he really bent over backward to accommodate our needs, without having to do so.   He communicates well in advance and is ready to help in any way possible - a very nice and thoughtful person and a great host.

Easy location for T-line transportation.  Seem to be a lot of good, well-priced Polish restaurants in his neighborhood (Try 'Polonia')",1
"Top bloke and a great host. Looks after his place keeping it clean with some added perks like bottled water, coffee and individually folded hand towels. Room was clean and tidy with a comfy memory foam mattress and aircon. Place is a short walk to the metro which gave fast access to the city (only 2 stops to the main south station) or a few more to the park etc. 
Best thing about this place though is the host, he's an open caring guy who goes the extra mile he helped me sort my laundry out and advised about the city when needed would recommend.",1
" Exactly as described. Jason was a fantastic host full of great places to eat and drink at, as well as what to go and see.",1
Everything was perfect! The place was clean and the bed really comfortable. Jason is a nice host. I recommend this place to everyone!!,1
The Apartment was very nice and Jason was great as well. Room had everything needed and the bed was comfortable. I really like the location because it was very easy getting around and the train station is within 5 min walking distance. I recommend it! ,1
Accommodating host! Place was clean with an extremely comfortable bed ☺ I love quick it was to get into downtown. Would definitely recommend!,1
"Jason was the BEST. My flight was delayed almost 4 hours and he opened the door for me at 3:30am. Talk about the best host ever. As for the space, everything was impeccably clean and nicely furnished. The bed was super comfy and he restocked towels in the bathroom every day. Wonderful host, wonderful space, 5 stars all around. Thank you, Jason!",1
"Staying at Jason has been a very good experience. He's a very nice person and the apartment is pretty. Our room was big, clean and with a super comfortable bed (I loved it!). While booking I had not understood that we'd have had to share the bathroom with his roommate too but we just stayed one night and worked just fine. As we got to Boston by car the apartment was in a very good spot as it's 1 min driving from the highway! Subway instead is 10 min walking, which is good too.",1
"Jason is a cool and relaxed guy and he has done everything to make me enjoy my stay in Boston. The room has AC, which is nice in the hot and humid Boston summer.",1
Awesome host! Makes you feel at home and helps you out with places to go around the area. Really good location too. Overall Really good Experience!,1
"Gracious host who was very accommodating with the amenities and arrangements, especially when settling in after a long red eye flight. This was my second trip to Boston and Jason had a part in making things better the second go around. ",1
"Jason was an amazing host. The apartment was just as described & very clean, organized. Though it is a working class neighborhood...otherwise  peaceful & very well connected by subway T line to downtown. 
But would recommend to any friend anytime. My first experience with airbnb  but definitely worth while !",1
Great place. Jason is kind and polite.,1
"Super helpful and accommodating host. Easy to get along with and respectful of boundaries but at the same time very warm, open and friendly. Bed was super comfy too!",1
"Jason was a great host - while we didn't cross paths, we didn't have any issues in getting into the place and he was accommodating by allowing us to leave our bags on Sunday while we went out for a final day of sightseeing. The room was clean and quite large, and the bed was comfy. He provided towels and other basic amenities, and the bathroom and other common areas were clean as well. His shower was quite nice, with a large rain shower head. The location is convenient, as it's a 5 minute walk to the T station where you can grab a train right downtown, or directly out to Cambridge/Harvard. 

All in all, a great experience. ",1
Nice neighbourhood. Relaxed athmosphere. Very open welcome from Jason. I felt at home.,1
"Jason is a superstar. Once we arrived, he came to greet us and helped us bring our heavy luggage upstairs to his great pad! We didn't spend a ton of time walking around his area- but he's super close to the T train. Takes just a few minutes to get anywhere.",1
"Jason was such a cool host, very quickly in responding and a great communicator. He made checking in very easy and smooth, he also upgraded me when there was a better vacancy. I am very grateful for that! Great location and will definitely stay there again if ever in Boston in the future! ",1
Very simple - Jason was the best host I met so far through Airbnb. I think he should get some kind of award :) expectations are exceeded. Room is clean. Location is awesome. Host is very helpful. ,1
"The room was great and the accommodations were neat, clean, and very comfortable.  Jason was the perfect host.  He respected my privacy and at the same time made me feel welcome.  I enjoyed speaking with him, and I truly feel like I made a new friend.  When do you get that feeling at a hotel?  I definitely will be staying at Jason's place again!  ",1
"Jason made our weekend trip to Boston really easy ! His apartment is indeed close to the Red Line which makes going in and out of town a formality. We also received our own set of keys which gave us total flexibility.

The room was clean and quiet, and all the useful informations were displayed on a cute note. The mattress was SO COMFY, perfect to relax after walking all day.

I would come back without any hesitation if I need a place to crash in Boston. Best of luck Jay !",1
"Jason was awesome, so was his place.  Honestly, a lot of other places that I have been to were good, but it was always the case that the photos looked better.  Jason's place was definitely better than it looks in the photos (at least for me). I felt that it was much more spacious than I had expected. The place is also really quiet at night, which I needed. It had everything I needed as well. 
Jason makes you feel like you're crashing at a friend's place. Of course, the kind and generous type of friend.  ",1
"Had a great stay; Jason was thoughtful, responsive, detail-oriented, unobtrusive, friendly, very helpful. I also really enjoyed the neighborhood that has a strong Polish background. Would definitely stay here again.",1
"Jason was awesome.  It was my first time using Airbnb, and he went the extra mile to make sure my needs were taken care of.  He even let me store my luggage in the living room while I explored the city a little more before my flight.  The bed was extremely comfortable, which contributed to the first good night's sleep for about a week (after working long hours at a conference nearby).  The apartment was very close to where I wanted to go, and I could even walk to Southie for the St. Patrick's Day parade, instead of taking an uber or lyft since the streets were blocked off.

All in all, it felt like I was home.  I hope other airbnb hosts are as accommodating as Jason was for me.  I'll definitely be using it again.",1
Jason's place is exactly like the pictures. The bed is very comfortable and the room is super quiet. Jason was the perfect host making me feel very welcomed into his home. I had dealt with travel delays earlier in the day and he had a nice calming energy about him. It was as if I was staying with an old friend!,1
"We had a great stay with Jason! We found his place easily by using public transportation and when we arrived Jason was kind and generous, and his place is beautiful and clean. My boyfriend enjoyed playing video games, while I enjoyed eating some delicious food from a restaurant nearby. We made some great memories and wish Jason well in all his future endeavors. He is a great host. ",1
"Jason is probably one of the friendliest host you'll find! He made me feel welcome from the moment I booked my stay in Boston. He was super helpful from the start! He gave me and my friend a really warm welcome when we arrived and he had a ton of small brochures of different sights in Boston and several maps which gave us an easy start to making our way around the city. He has a lot of recommendations to places to go for dinner/drinks etc. 

The apartment is very clean and it makes you feel at home. We didn't get to spend too much time around the house, but when we met him there he always engaged in conversation and asked us about how our trip was going. The pictures truly show what the room looks like! And the apartment is in a cute little street and it's blissfully quiet in that area! It's really a great location and it's easy to get anywhere from the apartment. 

I would definitely book this place again for my next visit to Boston!",1
"This is the second time I've stayed at Jason's place, and I have really enjoyed my self! It was really close to convention we were attending, and the area was really nice as well. The apartment was fantastic, he moved around the rooms, and redecorated from the last time I stayed and it looks great! I will keep coming to stay at Jason's every time I decide to come to Boston! 10/10",1
"Jason was very helpful, getting there was very straightforward and the room was tidy and the perfect size for what I needed. 

The area was conveniently located near the train station and allowed me to see Boston without ever being too far from my bed. 

Would definitely stay again! ",1
Stay with Jason was good. Wasn't there much but the room was nice and clean. Jason was very responsive with the few questions I had. ,1
"Jason was an excellent host. He was very welcoming and helpful when I arrived and during my stay by answering my questions and genuint caring and being interested in what I wanted to do. The room is exactly how it looks in the picture. Very nice, clean and just what I needed. I would have no problem of staying at Jason place again and really recommend Jason as a host.  ",1
"We had stayed with Jason while visiting Boston, and staying with Jason was a great experience. Jason is genuinely a friendly and kind host, and he made us feel so welcome. He went out of his way to accommodate us, and the room turned out to be just as pictured. Overall, a wonderful host in a wonderful city. Would recommend. ",1
"Jason was a great host. His apartment is very neat and cozy, and I would definitely stay with him again. The room I stayed in had an incredibly comfortable bed and even had the little things people don't think about like a fan and anti-wrinkle spray. His bathroom was very clean and the shower was fantastic! Lastly, Jason was very helpful with any questions we had and made staying in the city that much easier. ",1
"Stayed with Jason for a few days and couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Immaculate, comfortable, and quiet home, with an awesome host who's up for shooting the breeze or leaving you alone.  Thanks for the hospitality, Jason, see you around!",1
"The house is located at a very quiet street. And we found the parking space easily. The room was extremely clean and neat. Jason was very nice and friendly. He was very patient and recommended us where to go in a very short stay in Boston. I think he showed us the best of Boston so we enjoyed very much. Also we enjoyed our stay at his house since we haven't slept in such a quiet room for a long long time. Moreover, Jason texted me if there is anything that he could work on to improve the quality of stay. I was really impressed by that even though I could come up with one thing or two. I'll be at Boston with my mom in July. I hope that we could stay at Jason's house again!",1
"This is a great listing. The house is great. The room is awesome. Jason has water stocked for you in the fridge, and a really good descriptive brochure in the room that even had cups to uber and other transportation services. ",1
"Had an absolutely fantastic stay at Jason's place. The room is exactly as pictured, very spacious and super clean - just like the rest of his apartment. He made us feel very welcome and comfortable upon arrival and couldn't do more to help - advice, maps, cool apps to use etc. The place is in a quiet residential location just over 5 minute walk to a very convenient and quick sub into town (his place is located so that all trains on that line can be taken into town/back to his place which means you never wait long for a train!). Also lots of personal touches - 'info sheet' and little necessities provided (if needed) made the stay even better. Great host, great place, would definitely stay again if returning to Boston. ",1
Jason was able to assist my mother in directions and other kind gestures which made her first trip to Boston more relaxing and welcoming.,1
"I stayed at Jason's room for one night. He was very helpful, telling me how to order food from the nearest restaurant and how to travel to the place I wanted to go. ",1
"My husband and I stayed with Jason this weekend. It was perfect! The room was comfortable and quiet, so much so that we were able to keep the window open and fall asleep to a cool breeze and the sound of crickets (we're from New York, so this was a novelty to us). The bed was so comfy that we actually took a nap when we arrived, which we never do. There were thoughtful touches everywhere, from the well-stocked side table in the bedroom with everything from pens to maps to shower supplies, to the basket of neatly rolled washcloths in the bathroom (and nearby hamper). We were able to walk everywhere we needed to go, although I'll admit that at the end of the night we did avail ourselves of the Uber discount code Jason helpfully provided! And, not that it would have been anyone's fault if we had a hard time parking, but we were able to get a spot directly in front of the building, which was pretty sweet. Also, there's a rain showerhead in the bathroom; if that doesn't spark your interest, you are probably some kind of monster.

Jason is a friendly and attentive host who has clearly put a lot of time and care into making his place a welcoming retreat. Definitely recommended!",1
"Jason's place was a really convenient spot to stay in order to fully enjoy Boston.

His apartment is clean with a spacious bedroom and he was even kind enough to offer us a drink from his well-stocked in-house bar the first evening we met.

Jason was kind enough to provide lots of recommendations with regards to the local area and made sure our stay was an enjoyable one.",1
"Jason was very welcoming and helpful with suggestions for local food places and things to do! The house was clean, inviting and had a great ambiance! We would definitely stay here again!",1
"Jason was a terrific host, before getting to his apt he contacted me and gave all the instructions. The location is very convenient, 5min walk from the subway and quite easy to go downtown or to the airport. The apt is exactly what you see in the pictures, clean and the room is very spacious. The coffee machine and bottled water are a plus. I was visiting Boston to attend a conference and I was very busy, I only met Jason personally once, but everyday he texted me to check if I needed something. I definitely recommend Jason as a host! ",1
"It was very great to stay at Jason's place, very tidy, quiet and comfortable! He's so nice!",1
"Thank you, Jason, for being a wonderful host! My son and I had a fabulous time, and we LOVED that rainfall shower :) ",1
It was great staying at Jason's place. His place is only 2 stops away from downtown Boston. Takes less than 20 minutes to get downtown on the T. Jason's place was clean and comfortable. Jason is a very welcoming and accommodating host. I would highly recommend staying at his place!,1
"Jason is so kind. He replied my question  quickly. 
House is clean and cozy.",1
Place was comfortable and as described. We loved the convenient location near the metro and Jason was very helpful and kind. ,1
"The room and the apartment as a whole were neat and clean. Jason is very welcoming! I had a very late flight when checking in, and Jason made arrangements for me to check in at a very late hour. The room AC unit makes it easy to sleep in hot July. The apartment is very quiet, as promised. Bottled water in the fridge was a nice touch! 

Jason even upgraded me to a slightly larger room at no cost to me since the bigger room was available. 

The neighborhood itself is not too exciting, but it's a 5 min walk to Andrew train station which will get you downtown in 2/3 quick stops. Harborwalk is about a mile away if you want to go for a jog/walk. There are some large stores nearby but I never visited any of those. ",1
"Jason was very friendly and very easy to get in touch with. The room was very spacious and the apartment was very clean. It was an easy ~5 minute walk to the Andrew T stop, and a 20 minute ride into Boston. ",1
"This place was really great and it was clean. I was in town for a conference and I need a room to stay. In any case, I really enjoyed my stay and the host Jason was really nice. If I had a questions, he would always message me back in a timely manner. He even left some essentials and snacks, which was very nice. Regarding the neighborhood, it seemed nice and everyone I interacted with was friendly. While there I used the subway frequently, which was took about five minutes’ walk. Otherwise, you can always use ride-share apps as well to get where you are going. In brief, I was highly satisfied with my stay.",1
Just as listed. ,1
My wife and I had a great stay in Boston. Our first experience. Jason's apartment helped with this as it was just perfect. Very clean and well located. We had a chance to chat with Jason and he oriented our second day visit. Thanks again. ,1
"Nice, cozy, convenient location, and most important : great host. Constantly getting in touch to make sure that the guest is ok.

This trip, my luggage was delayed for a few days. Later, the airline said they would called before the delivery between 1-4 am. I didn't receive the call that night but found my luggage in front of my bedroom in the morning. I couldn't thank him enough for bringing my large bag up 3 floors.",1
Jason greeted us as we came in and made us feel right at home. ,1
"Jason is really a good host, recommending some good places in Boston for me to visit and have dinner. The room is clean and location is great! I'll choose to stay here when I come to Boston again.",1
The place was very clean and cozy. The bed was very comfortable and the air conditioner in the room worked great! It was in a great location for the business I was doing and overall I had a very pleasant stay! I would recommend!,1
"What a fantastic air bnb! 

I stayed with my boyfriend for 5 days and loved every minute of it. 

The apartment itself is super clean and very chic. The room feels
Boutiquey and very spacious and the aircon was a blessing in the hot Boston summer. 

Location wise the T (train) is 5 minutes walk away and Jason's amazing stash of offer codes had us taking free uber/lyft taxis for most of our trip - amazing! 

As for Jason himself he really deserves his rep as a super host. He's incredibly friendly and professional and really went out of his way to accommodate us (with our funny arrival/departure times) and make us feel welcome. He gave us some great recommendations for places to eat/drink/visit and even provides a guide book to use during your stay. He was so easy to communicate with and we left feeling more like friends than just his guests. 

Thanks for an awesome stay Jason - we'll be back! ",1
"Jason was great! I had an early train in and he arranged with me how to drop off my bag since he had guests the night before. I was pleasantly surprised that he was actually there and greeted me when I came in. He did everything to try and ensure I could check in a bit early, which was much appreciated after an overnight train ride. The room and apartment was super clean, and he even had items like granola bars, water and things to freshen up with in the room. He was very helpful and friendly. The neighborhood is conveniently located by the Red Line, which will easily get you into downtown Boston in a few stops. ",1
"Lovely and beautiful home in a friendly, quiet neighborhood! We stayed in Unit 2, which was very spacious and charming. There actually was only one room (not two, as listed in the description) on the 3rd floor with 2 full size beds; the other two rooms had queen size beds. The master bathroom on the second floor was amazing! Everyone took turns either soaking in the jacuzzi tub or enjoying the jetted shower. There is plenty of space in the living room/kitchen area for a large group to dine together, play games, or watch a movie.

The walls are very thin in this home, and noise travels very easily. You can hear normal-level conversations with the door closed from the room next door, or even the floor above or below you. ",1
Our stay was wonderful.  Great host. Great House. Great area.  What else could you ask for?  ,1
Aihua was a great host! The house and location couldn't have been more perfect for me and my family. If ever in the area I will defiantly book with Aihua again. ,1
"Our house near Harvard was spacious and clean and we had everything we needed. It was a great location and we were able to get around easily and truly enjoyed our first visit to Boston. 
Our host, let us check in early which was very helpful.  Even though there is only parking on one side of the street we didn't have a problem. ",1
"We really liked the electronic lock that allowed us to be able to get into the house without keys.  The house was not as nice as we had expected at the rate charged.  The basement bedroom was the only one with a bath with some privacy, but the low ceilings, steep stairs and uneven flooring made it feel like it was a frat house, and the two double beds in that room made it less than ideal for a married couple (parents) to stay in with a family.",1
Aihua's listing was cozy and welcoming - plenty of towels and bathroom supplies. The keyless entry made it very convenient and safe. The listing was very accurate and I would certainly recommend this listing as a viable option for a family up to 10 guests (5 couples / beds) in town for the Boston Marathon or other. The listing is close enough to public transit to access all parts of the city as well. ,1
"We spend 4 nights at the house and the bottom line is that we had a good experience. We were 6 adults one baby and one small child.  The house  was well  equipped (Towels, sheets). We had good communication with the host and she agreed to check us in before the ""Official time"". Overall it was good experience.
Parking arrangements were  problematic since there were two parking slots for us and the neighbor  apartment that block each other and in the morning when we want to go out we found ourselves blocked. ",0
"The apartment was lovely and exactly as described. Clean, well maintained. Perfect location with easy access to the metro, shopping, great restaurants. Would absolutely stay again. 

Jason answered all questions we had before our trip, and got back to me promptly. Very friendly and helpful. ",1
"This was my first experience and it will forever change how I travel from now on! I loved the location and have realized you get so much more from being immersed in the local culture as opposed to being insulted within the confines of a hotel. The location of this brownstone apartment could not have been better for feeling like a Bostonian. Although it was an older building, the proximity to Newbury Street, (the equivalent of Rodeo Drive in Boston) the Boston Library, and Boston Commons park was fantastic! The room was comfortable and the kitchen well stocked with equipment. What impressed me the most, however, was Jason's concern for my comfort. He let me know before I arrived that the air conditioner had broken–and, with a freakish heat wave hitting Boston that week, he had to order the replacement online. A member of Jason's team was waiting for me (and the air conditioner) when I checked in and had it set up shortly thereafter. Jason followed up more than once to make certain I was cool and comfortable. The point I'd like to make is that a good experience doesn't mean that everything went perfectly. A good experience is when a potential problem is handled in an effective and timely manner, as was the case here. I would definitely stay at this location again! Thanks Jason!",1
"I love that studio so much. This is my first experience to book a room at Airbnb. It's wonderful and amazing. I never thought there's a way I can travel like this. Jason is a awesome host. I forgot to call him, and he call me first. That was so thoughtful. His studio is clean and cozy. I share the pictures to my friends. They just don't believe I can find such a ""hotel"" in Boston! I had a good time in Boston, in Jason's Studio. Highly recommend!",1
Ideally located to visit Boston. Everything you want to see is walking distance from this cozy studio (good for a couple). Pictures are accurate. Jason and his friend Ryan are very helpful and flexible ! I appreciate my stay ! ,1
"The apartment and the neighborhood were as advertised - both were great. There are many excellent sights, bars, and restaurants within easy walking distance. The apartment itself is small but very nicely furnished and very clean. I would certainly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in the area.",1
"Our experience at Jason's place was fantastic. He was very responsive and gaining access was a breeze. The studio was clean and Jason provided everything we needed. Additionally, the location was incredible......close to amazing restaurants, shopping an d nightlife. I'm not sure you'll find a better price and location in Boston!",1
"Jason's garden-level studio is in an ideal location, in the heart of Back Bay and close to several subway and bus lines. The studio itself is really comfortable and well-appointed; it was impeccably clean and the Internet connection was fast. The bathroom is modern. Jason was extremely responsive to our questions and was a terrific host who seemed genuinely concerned that everything was perfect for our stay.",1
"Jason was very responsive to all the questions we had, the studio is clean and the neighborhood is very charming, I would highly recommend to book with Jason. ",1
"Great location in Back Bay.  Bit tricky to get the key lock open as we arrived in the night and it is difficult to see the numbers.  Make sure you have a light of some sort to help you.  Very close to main shopping areas and bars/restaurants.
Appt itself is well equipped.  There are a few things that are annoying about the place but Jason responded to our issues very quickly  and has promised to look into them.  The main issue is the noise from other apartments ( this appt is the basement floor with other appts above it) , we think when using the shower.  This noise woke us up each day between 4 & 5 am, and we are not light sleepers at all, but this did disturb our rest. 
Overall we had a good time, and assuming that the issues we raised are resolved, we would return and recommend you to stay in this apartment.",1
"The apartment may be petite but very tastefully furnished--perfect for two people. 

Great location with good choices of food and shopping.Ideal for short trips and central to most places you need to get to in Boston/Cambridge. 

Host is friendly and very reachable during entire stay.",1
"Jason was the perfect host! Even in the distance he managed to provide all needs that my parents and I had. 
If you go to Boston that's the perfect spot to be, beautiful neighborhood with a walking distance to everything. 100% recommendable ",1
"I will start by saying I would defiitely stay here again.

I am an Airbnb vet - this is one of the most responsive hosts you will get.

Absolutely beautiful neighboorhood. Took Uber anywhere I wanted to go for less than $12. Walked a few blocks to Copley Station for subway access across the city. Walked through Boston Commons to many great dinner spots.

The room is small, but larger than many nearby hotel rooms that don't include a stove and fridge (this does). You will be on the first floor so with ATT you won't get a signal inside the room, but you can put your phone in the window or step outside. You get free Netflix, but not ""live"" TV per se. That being said, are you really here to watch TV? 

Bed is comfortable. Neighboorhood is amazing (people were taking pictures). There is some noise inside the building, but it dies down early and I always bring earplugs. 

Just don't expect a lot of space and you'll be fine. Great value.",1
"Everything worked very well with Jason! House is very comfortable, location is the best in Boston, close walk to everything. I would definitely reccomend it.",1
"Jason was very responsive to any questions I had. The room was exactly as pictured. I didn't encounter any issues, and had a great time walking around the lovely neighborhood. I only stayed for a 1 night business trip this time, but would definitely stay again! Thanks!",1
Jason was very helpful. I had trouble finding the key and called him and he was able to help. Then I left my suit hanging in the place and he again contacted me and was extra helpful in getting the suit back. The apartment is very comfortable and very clean. I would highly recommend it. It is ground floor so if you have heavy luggage good place to stay. On a few steps down to enter. ,1
"Jason was a very responsive and accommodating host. The apartment is on a great street in the Back Bay within walking distance of many of Boston's best sites, restaurants, and neighborhoods. The place itself is clean and well appointed. All in all I had a great experience and will hope to stay here again on my next trip to Boston!",1
Great location. Nice clean room with fast internet. ,1
"We really had a great time this weekend. First of all, the appartement is perfectly located. You can walk to anywere inthe city. You also have great restaurant and an huge park next to the appartement. The only negative thing we could say was about the parking. Its complicated to find one and you can only have access to it for 2 hours except if you go to newsbury street where you can find some parking for 50$ a day. We would definitely recommand this place. And jason is always available. He did answer so fast to our question we felt like home. ",1
"Jason's apartment is in the perfect location, not to mention it is located on a beautiful brownstone scenic street. It is exactly where you want to be when visiting Boston, close to everything. Jason was a great host, and he responded just minutes after every message I sent him. Very attentive to his guests' needs. I would recommend friends to stay here as well. ",1
The apartment was exactly as pictured and the location was fabulous!! Jason accommodated our last minute request to check out late without any issues. Would definitely stay here again if we are in the area. ,1
Very cute and clean apartment. Perfectly located. Jason was very helpful and always responded within minutes to any request or comnent. Recommend it 100% and would definitely wanna stay here again. ,1
"Jason was a wonderful host. He was very polite, flexible and understanding. His studio in Back Bay is in an awesome location, walking distance to almost everywhere we needed to go. It was also tastefully decorated and clean. I highly recommend booking with Jason if Boston is in your plans",1
The space was exactly as described.  Jason was a great host.  He is as responsive as it gets.  I would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Jason!,1
"Jason responded to all correspondence very quickly - at times immediately.  He graciously accommodated a request for me to check-in a couple of hours early.  Check-in was easy.  The studio was clean, and in a nice neighborhood and great location within the city. I'd recommend this apartment to others!",1
"Great place to stay in Boston for a city trip: perfect location, clean and looks exactly like in the pictures. Jason is super responsive and helps out with questions you have about your trip. ",1
"My partner and I stayed in Jason's lovely studio apartment for a quick getaway weekend in Boston.  The apartment is cozy and comfortable!  It's a wonderfully walkable location to anything and everything you'd want to experience in Boston.  The bed is comfy and the wifi fast.  The building is a little noisy, but we were there over a holiday weekend so I have a feeling this had something to do with it.",1
"Jason's apartment is on one of the prettiest streets in Boston, quiet residential area yet close to subways, downtown etc. The Apartment is kept exceptionally clean, well furnished and well equipped.
Jason made the check-in and check-out very easy. 
Highly recommend, great experience.",1
I reserved this location for my mother to come visit me in the Back Bay. The apartment was great. Super clean. She really enjoyed the space. Gave her an authentic Back Bay experience. Will definitely book again. ,1
"A great apartment in a beautiful part of town, walking distance from everything we wanted to see. Place was clean and comfortable. Would recommend!",1
"Staying at Jason's place was my first AirBnB experience and it was perfect! I'm originally from Boston and when I came across Jason's listing, I knew it was just what I was looking for.  It didn't disappoint.  The studio is so charming and private.  It had everything I needed to live comfortably for a few days (extra towels, toilet paper, hair dryer, etc) Also, the bed is Tempur-Pedic and sooooo comfy!! It was truly a home away from home.  The neighborhood is the prettiest in the city and the location is prime.  It's located just two blocks away from the city's best restaurants and shopping.  You really can't pick a better spot. Jason was super responsive and answered all of my Q's in a very timely manner.  I would def stay here again!",1
"The apartment is very good. Perfect location, clean and comfortable. I would recommend this place to others.",1
"Jason's apartment is beautiful and very clean! What a great location - walking distance from Boston Commons, Charles Street, Newbury Street. I had such a wonderful stay and would highly recommend staying here.",1
Great experience. Jason was very responsive with everything. Helpful!!!  His place was amazing. Me and my girlfriend had a great time!!,1
"This apartment was adorable, and the perfect stay was made possible by Jason. He was very prompt with his responses and helpful.",1
"This room was a ground level studio apartment right by the charles. It was just as the pictures showed, clean and spare. The bed was comfortable! I had a couple of questions for Jason the night of, he answerd my calls and texts promptly and kindly. One warning-parking in the area is mostly resident only. We lucked out with a spot but were heading for a garage.",1
"clean, comfortable, and the location was perfect! The neighborhood made us easily fall in love with Boston.. but the parking was a bit of an issue (starting at 8am there's a 2-hour meter you have to feed. which means you have to constantly move your car until 6pm). Overall the place was the cherry on top to a great trip! ",1
"Great spot in the heart of back bay.  Jason was helpful and responsive upon arrival.  Apartment was safe, clean, attractive, and couldn't be in a better location.  All around a great experience.  ",1
Perfect location! It was such a cozy and clean experience. ,1
"The place is very nice and clean, and the location is great.  There was good WiFi and a 24 hour FedEx nearby with workstations, which was helpful to me.  Theres also a gym nearby.",1
"What a treat staying at Jason's apartment.  I have used airbnb multiple times, and am still surprised by the level of professionalism and hospitality garnered by the hosts. Jason was super quick to answer any and all my questions via email and text messages.  His apartment was beautiful, the location better than we could imagine, with a quick 5 minute walk to the metro, and to plenty of places to shop and eat. The shower had plenty of hot water and great water pressure. The bedding was better than any hotels with great pillows, and fluffy duvet. Overall wonderful trip. Wed definitely go back if Jason would have us again! ",1
"jason is so good,he told me   everything,and the home is very great!!!!!I love boston!!!!!",1
"This place is a gem in the middle of Boston! The location cannot be beat, and the apartment is a perfect, quiet, comfortable get-away. The bed is comfortable and the Roku set-up fully supported some Netflix binge watching on a snowy weekend. Jason is a great host! We hope to come back again soon.",1
Jason's place was exactly as advertised. The room is wonderfully cozy. I personally loved how close it was to Boston Commons. Subway and other public transportation is all an easy walking distance. Jason responds quickly and was helpful with any and all questions.,1
"Beautiful apartment in a charming neighborhood! The photos look just like the apartment, clean, homey and comfortable! Jason was very kind and helpful - I will recommend all my colleagues stay here when they visit the Boston office. ",1
"The place was just as described, no issues. It was very convenient to the convention center.",1
"Jason is a wonderful host. We had trouble finding the key (since it snowed) he helped us right away. He responded super fast with whatever concerns we had(we blew a fuse during our stay and he helped to to fix it) The apartments is very close to downtown Boston which is great. We just walked around at night and found a really good restaurant for dinner. Overall, it was a great experience, would love to stay again!!",1
I had a great stay at Jason's flat. All was as expected and the process of getting in and leaving was smooth and simple. The location is perfect. ,1
"Staying at Jason's place was a great choice for a person using Airbnb for the first time (me).  The place was the perfect size, and being in Back Bay, it was right in the middle of everything.  Close to Boston University, close to downtown and really close to Newbury St.  Jason's place was pretty well kept, and he was accommodating on letting us drop off our bags early and even gave us a great recommendation for a place to grab a Boston seafood dinner.  Wouldn't have stayed in Boston any other way.",1
Excellent! ,1
"Jason' s place is in the great Backbay neighborough in a walking distance of T and shops. Nice little parlor level studio very clean and a great tempur bed. Jason was very responsive to all my inquiries over the phone. The one little drawback for me was not to be able to open the patio door nor the windows to get fresh air in the room. But, Jason said this  was going to be fixed.",1
"Jason was respondent and helpful to any questions I had during the weekend. The space itself is cozy and comfortable and is in an excellent location- cannot stress that enough.  During colder weather the windows are old and create a huge draft. On the flip side, the windows are only one side of the studio, so natural sunlight is limited. ",1
"He's right. Incredible location. it's near by Newbury st, so you can shopping all day. (bunch of restaurant too)and quiet place also. it is same as picture and cozy. but one thing, in my case i was not comfortable with bed. maybe it's too soft to me..except that, I have a good memory of Jason's house. Nice. you should go.",1
Apartment is great in a convenient location in Back Bay-just a few minutes walk to a T stop or the common. Would stay here again. Any questions I had were responded to promptly. ,1
"I will definetely be back. Great location, comfy bed, good value! The location is perfect, on one of the prettiest streets in Boston, just two blocks from the Public Garden. Thank you!",1
"Jason was quick to responf to all of my questions and made renting my first Airbnb an easy process. The apartment was perfectly located, and we could walk most places.",1
"We stayed for 4 nights for the Boston Marathon and the location was PERFECT! Loved being in Back Bay, walkable area, and close to the T. Jason was extremely flexible and great to work with! Loved having a kitchen, too! ",1
1st time staying at this location but 2nd stay at Jason's location.  Clean and well kept!  Great location in downtown Boston.  Definitely recommended. ,1
"Jason made our short visit to Boston very easy and wonderful. He gave a detailed explanation of how to get to the place and where to find everything. He was very accommodating with our check-out time which helped us maximize our time in the city! The place was very clean and the bed was super comfy which was exactly what we needed after a long day of walking around. If we're ever back in Boston or know someone that's visiting, we'll definitely recommend Jason's place. ",1
Nice clean apartment with an extremely comfy bed and great wifi service. The host was very responsive to any questions we had before and during our stay. The only item missing in the apartment is a table to eat. The accent table provided is simply to small to eat on. ,1
"really homie place,  I stayed for 5 nights and it was extremely comforting. Memory foam mattress is really relaxing. location is extremely great, i love shopping and it is 5 minutes walk from Newbury street. The neighborhood itself is really quiet. really like it",1
"Jason was very responsive to texts and questions. The apartment was easy to locate and very accessible, in a beautiful part of Boston. It was exactly as pictured and extremely clean and functional. High quality furnishings and amenities were provided. The location was central to many popular sites and close to public transport. Heating worked well. The only qualm was the bed - my boyfriend and I both kept rolling into the middle, which was a little disruptive on our first night but we slept well the rest of our time there. Overall we were very pleased with our experience at Jason's apartment. ",1
"Great place, roomy, clean very quiet neighborhood in an ideal location. I would stay again and probably will! ",1
Place was clean -- easy check in. Good experience.,1
"we love our stay at Jason's. location is perfect, very short walk to newbury street with its shops and restaurants,,to boylston street and copley T stop.  the apartment is small but lovely, mattress maybe too soft for some people but not me.  jason is very responsive and we had smooth check in/out.",1
Great location. Quick responses from Jason when needed. ,1
Our host was very helpful.   The neighbourhood and proximity to everything Boston was terrific.   Pictures were indicative of the actual accommodation.  ,1
Amazing place. Everything was as advertised. Can't recommend this spot enough. Wouldn't hesitate to return. Thanks Jason! ,1
"We loved staying at Jason's place and would highly recommend it. Jason was very responsive, and even went out of his was to make an extra accommodation for us. 

The Good: 

-Location! Tons of restaurants and shopping nearby. The Copley station is about a 5 min walk. 
- The place was clean and had all of the necessary amenities. 
- The bed was great.
- The water pressure in the shower is amazing.
- The portable AC unit kept us comfortable at night. It was hot when we visited!

The not so good:

- The place is pretty small, but was fine for the two of us. 
- The apartment seems to mostly be wired to one circuit breaker which can be overloaded fairly easily. We had to make sure the portable AC unit was turned off before we used the hair dryer or iron, or else the breaker would trip. 
- A little noisy. Street noise was audible, but this did not affect us from sleeping soundly. ",1
"My boyfriend and I loved the apartment in Back Bay.  It was only a few blocks from newbury street, Copley plaza, and just about everything.  The apartment itself was cozy and had a lot of light for a garden unit.  

The bed was comfy but seemed to be falling apart.  Another issue we had was that a fuse blew, causing all the lights to go out, and when I contacted the host, he didn't know where the box was to reset it and took over an hour to get back to us. 

Overall, for the price, the unit was great.  We loved the location and the roku!",1
Host was very responsive to questions.  Really amazing location.  Definitely enjoyed my stay.,1
"This is the place to stay! Very comfortable bed, great shower and nice kitchen - the star market is within walking distance. Beautiful neighborhood within walking distance to many popular destinations and the Copley station train is just a few blocks away.",1
"Great apartment in an amazing location. Everything was exactly as described and the host gave lots of additional information like good places to eat, visit and shop. 
Would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a place in Boston.",1
This apartment was amazing. Perfectly clean and beautiful with a great location. ,1
"The apartment is nice and cozy and location cannot be beat.   Everything was very clean.  Also Jason is very responsive and available to answer questions.  

One thing that guests should know that this particular listing is more or less like a Hotel-- nobody actually lives here, and it is rented out 24/7, and it certainly has more of a hotel feel then your stereotypical Airbnb.  Also be prepared to supply your own soap and shampoo as none is provided.  ",0
"Great location, easy to check in/out and Jason was really great about responding quickly. I highly recommend this place if you want to stay in Back Bay.",1
All great. No complaints.,1
Great location. Walkable to almost everything or a cheap Uber ride. Jason was super quick with communications and an minor issue that arose. First AirBnB experience and would do it again and again because of this experience. Thanks Jason!!,1
"Jason was very accommodating, and got back to us right away with responses when we had questions.",1
"good location, everything we needed for a long weekend. easy to work with. ",1
"A beautiful place exactly as described on a quiet tree lined street in Boston's best neighbourhood. Clean and comfortable room with A/C, well equipped kitchen and full sized fridge. Within walking distance to the city and Fenway Park. Communication with Jason was seamless and we would definitely stay again.",1
"A perfect studio for a Boston visit, one to which we definitely expect to return. Everything one or two people need, exactly as described, and extremely convenient, pleasant, and relaxing. ",1
"Communication with Jason is prompt.  We felt very welcomed. The apartment location is the best, close to everywhere. ",1
"We loved our stay in Boston. Back Bay was a perfect central location for us to easily walk to our destination for the day. What a beautiful, safe, quiet and quaint neighborhood. Jason's place was a perfect size for the 2 of us and we would come back in a heartbeat. ",1
"Jason's unit was clean, comfortable, and in an excellent location. Would absolutely stay again. Thank you, Jason!",1
"Great location, good communication with host.",1
"Great location, clean and pleasant, with enough in the kitchen and bathrooms to make it very usable.  The private entrance makes it even easier.  Jason was very responsive to any questions or communication.  The air conditioner kept a hot day under control, the downside is that it is loud (though a constant sound) for anyone not used to this kind of white noise.  If you are light sensitive, bring eyeshades -- summer light comes early, even though there are shades on the windows.  Over all, a very good experience.  ",1
"Jason's apartment was absolutely perfect for our overnight stay in Boston!  It truly could not have been more ideal.  Though we've lived in Maine for 15 years, we're formerly from the Boston area and are very familiar with Back Bay. For anyone looking to experience Boston, you couldn't make a better choice! We'd love to stay again!",1
"Jason's place was perfect for our quick stay in the city. It's clean, spacious, accessible, close to city, walking distance to the T - it had everything we needed. Jason provided excellent instructions and made our stay smooth and easy. Parking was a little difficult (it is everywhere in Boston), but Jason had lots of recommendations for us on that front as well. I'd recommend Jason's place in Back Bay and stay there again! ",1
"This was a great place to stay. Clean, easy check-in and location. Would gladly stay again the next time I'm in Boston! ",1
Great location. Couldn't be beat. Highly recommended. ,1
"Jason's apartment is perfect, just as described. The location is amazing, a beautiful street very quiet but with many restaurants and shops at walking distance. The apartment was clean and Jason was always easy to contact and gave us very simple instructions for check in. We will definitely return to this place if we come back to Boston! ",1
The studio was exactly how it appeared in pictures! It was perfect for our quick weekend getaway. I would definitely recommend it and stay here again!,1
Kartik was very polite and respectful. He made my first airbnb experience pleasant. The room was clean and and comfortable. No complaints!,1
"I stayed at his room once, and it was very comfortable. I could arrived there very easily because the location is close to a train station. 

And the host looked nice and actually was so nice. My room was also large enough for me to stay. I could enjoy the stay because my private room (desk, chair, air bed), my private full bathroom, towel and hair dryer were prepared by him. 

If I'll go to Boston again, I want to stay again. ",1
"Kartik was very friendly and the house was perfect. Everything works well.
I do recommend to stay there. 5 min from the orange line.",1
"My husband and I loved staying here! It was a quick trip (only one night), but Kartik was very accommodating and flexible. The room and facilities were clean and it was a short walk from public transportation. I highly recommend staying here!",1
"Karthik has an awesome place! Commute is very convenient, the room is nice and spacious, and the 2 bathrooms keep mornings friction-free. Karthik was also easy to communicate with and he tried to be as flexible as possible with us, which was very appreciated. Also, he has nice roommates and he offered us ice cream :)",1
"Very good, we two girls are very late in the subway station, he came to meet us, very moved.
The room is very clean and comfortable.
Towel, bath dew.
Very intimate, Boston would also choose here next time.

"Kartid was a great host. Extremely helpful and very reliable. He was there to meet us a the door when we arrived and went out of his way to make sure we were happy guests.
Highly recommended
Elliot",1
"Kartik is such a lovely person... so warm and welcoming, happy to offer any assistance, and wonderfully communicative and accommodating. His place is clean, quiet, & comfortable. It is located well to get around quite easily via public transit in Boston. Such sweet memories and a cherished experience for my first weekend in Boston!!",1
"Kartik is a very welcoming host, helpful and flexible ! We set an hour for check-in by email first and when we arrived, everything was ready for our arrival: a nice room with fresh towels and cute little ""hotel-like"" details such as a map of the surroundings, shampoos, soap and cereal bars for breakfast ! Just lovely. The room is clean and quiet. 

Location of Kartik's appartment is also perfect, 5-10 minutes walk from the train station then 15 from the city center. 

Definitely happy ! Thanks again Kartik !",1
"Everything was perfect. Kartik was nice enough to arrange check-in perfectly. The room was even better than we expected. Really nice.  We only stayed two days but if we had the chance to travel to Boston again, we would book this place without any doubt. ",1
"Kartik was extremely welcoming and nice. The room was spacious, clean, bright, and well-equipped with everything you could ever need; including a small paper stacks of maps around the area. The entire apartment is clean and organized. The area is quiet, actually nice and pretty close by everything. Kartik offered me tea, coffee, or even the food that he was cooking, and I appreciated it. His flatmate was also nice, and I would definitely like to stay at their place again if I ever go to the Boston area anytime in the future.",1
"Kartik greeted me upon arrival.  He'd added some little touches for ""his guest"" to feel comfortable (bottle of water, wifi posted in room, etc).  Since he was headed out, he asked if i wanted to walk with him to the T Station.  Not knowing where it was and needing to get there, I said yes.  He then acted as a tour guide for his neighborhood, pointing out landmarks and sharing insights.  I had similar interactions with him over the next two days.  I was not surprised to hear that his room is booked over 90% of each month.",1
"Very nice place to stay, the host was there waiting for us to show his home and was more than cordial. Had maps and other amenities prepared for us, which was extremely convenient. I really enjoyed the private deck out back, which I don't believe was pictured in the listing. The only downside came in the morning when we realized that the AC was either not turned on or was inoperable. Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Boston. ",1
The listing was accurate and the house provided all the amenities we could wish for. Kartik was very hospitable and helped us in learning about the surrounding area and the property. The house and room were beautifully made and helped us settled quickly after a late arrival. It was a short but perfect stay.,1
"Kartik was an amazing host, from start to finish. He actually let me in a little before the check-in time so I could take a shower after a long flight. The house is well-located, less than 10 mins from the T station in a very calm neighborhood. Everything was clean and I had well enough space for my things. The shared bathrooms were also clean I and I didn't have any problem with them. Kartik offered me space in the fridge, and was very caring during my stay, asking to see if everything was ok. I would definetely stay there again if I have the chance!",1
We only stayed for one night but it was extremely convenient and a in a location where we could easily walk to places instead of taking the subway. The room was exactly as advertised and clean. We would consider staying again in the future. ,1
"My stay in Kartik's house was great.
I had what I need, a clear and quiet room that allowed I rest very well.
The subway is near the house and I didn't waste  money with cab. 
So I recommend Kartik's house.",1
"Kartik was an amazing host! He left us a welcome basket and towels with information about the apartment and what to do in the city. The first night he recommended delivery restaurants, and helped me order food from a great Indian place. Kartik also gave me a ride to the center, and went out of his way to make me feel comfortable. 
The room has access to a private porch in the back which was great for hanging out (and if you're a smoker would be really convenient). The room and everything else in the apartment were incredibly clean. There's 2 full bathrooms. 
We had a car there so I'm not sure how accessible it is to public transportation, but there's there a convenient store nearby and tons of street parking.  ",1
"Kartik made us feel very welcome.  He was an excellent host!  He made sure someone was there to greet us and let us drop off our luggage prior to check-in, which was much appreciated.  He made sure we were comfortable and felt welcome in his home during our stay.  The location was perfect - very nice neighborhood.  It was easy to get to and just a short walk from the T.  The room was as described and Kartik had numerous travel brochures available.  The bottled water and organic granola bars in the room were a nice touch too!",1
"Amazing and comfortable!!!
Kartik was very friendly and received us earlier because of our early trip.
The house is extremely clean and the bedroom is amazingly comfortable. Kartil gave us some maps and cereal bars, very kind.
Even being just two girls alone,  we felt extremely safe with him and his roommates, all of them were kind and treated us with respect.
The best part was to watch the soccer game and drink a beer with Kartik, making me feel like was my own place. Totally recommend the place for one night or longer periods, is well located and make you feel comfortable .

",1
The listing was very accurate! Kartik was a superb host. The apartment was incredibly clean. Shower products provided along with maps. Kind and respectful occupants. 7 minute walk to the orange line (Roxbury T metro stop). We enjoyed our stay very much! The room is attached to a small outdoor patio. The bed is very comfortable. Towels are provided. Access to 2 bathrooms. Access to fridge/kitchen. ,1
"The cozy room provided by Kartik is exactly as what he described. I had a great time when living there. And, thank Kartik for providing an energy bar when I just arrived. Also thank you for providing the travel brochure, which helped me a lot :) 
Kartik also provided free coffee [help yourself to make one] and left a particular space in the refrigerator for his guests, which was helpful for guests who would like to make breakfast themselves.  
To Kartik: just one personal suggestion -- if you could add a small trash can covered by a plastic bag in the cozy room, it would make the room more perfect :)",1
Kartik was a great host...perfect place for zipping into the city for the evening.,1
"The host made us feel very welcome and was very helpful with questions that we had while we were there. It was only a private room in an apartment, but we had the use of bathrooms, kitchen, and laundry as well. It was comfortable and close enough to the subway for convenient travel connections in and out of Boston proper. It was worth the price, which was still below most hotels in the area.... a big plus for us since when we travel, we don't ever have time to use and pay for the amenities that so many hotels have like gyms, pools, restaurants, etc. It was a basic place to stay that gave us everything that we needed.",1
"I booked Kartik's room for a colleague of mine who was in Boston on business. She said it was a clean, comfortable room in a good location. Kartik was very communicative and made the process super easy.",1
"The room was fine, clean, comfy bed and a working fan. Location wasn't great, 10/15 min walk to the subway and then another 20 mins to town, no cafes or bars close by - if you're looking for that sort of air Bnb experience. The boat dos leave a few maps and directions though which were helpful. Typical noises you would expect from an apartment share as well as the room is directly next to the kitchen. A fine room.  ",1
"I haven't stayed in too many airbnbs but this one was the best I've experienced so far. The room was clean and very private. We felt welcomed but the hosts left us to our own devices. In fact, we didn't see them once we arrived. We had access to a basically private bathroom that was very clean. The bed was very comfortable and the little amenities they left for us were great! Thank you!",1
"Everything is good,the owner is so nice and the location is near the subway.",1
"Quick response. Beautiful flat. Nice roommates. Clean room AND two bathrooms.
Everything worked out pretty well.
Thank you!",1
"This place is great! 
Great great location -- I stayed for 3 nights and every meal I could walk to chinatown and satisfy my cravings for legit Chinese food! Also it's only 1min's walk to Boston Common and AMC Loews, which is just great. 
Yes, sometimes it's pretty loud out there, which is described pretty clear in listing description. If you are a light sleeper you might need to think twice. But as I am not a light sleeper and I was just so tired these days, I found that I slept just like a baby. 
Wentao is a great host! He's very considerate, helpful, attentive, making sure everything went smoothly. It was such a pleasure to meet him! ",1
"Jordan was a great host. He let us check in early, and was easily reachable throughout our stay. He was very kind and even let us pick the tomatoes in the backyard. The apartment was very clean. The location was great as well, very close to Airport station on the blue line. We would definitely book with Jordan again.",1
"Me and three friends stayed at Jordan's home in East Boston while in town for a wedding. It's a very minimalist space with big, comfy air mattresses for a good night sleep. There are a few good coffee spots and restaurants just down the way. Also, you cannot beat the access to the T and airport transportation. Jordan was very accommodating and quick to respond to all my questions and concerns. ",1
Great and friendly host,1
The listing was as described: simple and clean with necessary amenities. It was our first airbnb experience and it was wonderful! The place was very conveniently located and my toddler also loved it since we used the small third room as his very own playroom! The air mattresses were comfortable and there was plenty of space to prep meals. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone else who is looking for a comfortable place to stay. Jordan was also very quick to respond to questions and sent thorough instructions. ,1
Good ,1
"We stayed at Jordan´s place for 2 nights. He was very friendly in letting us drop off our luggage early and check out late on the last day, since we had a late flight. 
We arrived just after the former guests have left. Since we would be gone for the day, we figured, he would clean the place during the day. But when we came back late at night, the bathroom especially was still very dirty. After we called him the next day, he cleaned it.  
The whole place is as minimalistic as it gets. There is one AIR mattress (not very comfortable) and a cupboard in each bedroom, a table and chairs in the living room (no couch), one empty spare room, the small bathroom and then the kitchen, which is not very clean, either. We did not use it.
The place could use some renovating and is not homey at all. If you are only looking for a place to crash, this may be fine. Boston is expensive and maybe this is what you get for $177/night. 
We would definitely not book it again, although Jordan was really friendly and helpful with tips for the area. 
And yes, it is very close to the Airport MTB Station. You can walk there in a few minutes.  ",0
"Jordan was a great host. We never actually got to meet him given our tight schedule but the home serves the purpose of a rest stop not really a place to spend all of your time despite how welcoming the kitchen is. I cannot stress how ideal the location is..LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION!!! My friend and I only came in to sleep because we wanted to spend most of our time exploring so the air mattresses were sufficient. Before we arrived, Jordan gave us directions from the airport along with a list of places to check out and they were a great help. ",1
"This apartment is a great value.  The apartment was clean and welcoming.  The kitchen was great for cooking.  I got a great night's sleep.  

Jordan was extremely attentive.  He provides clear instructions and gave me great food recommendations.  

Being able to walk straight to the airport makes this place a smart choice.  

",1
Listing description not accurate and we cannot comment on our host as we never saw him. Central location was excellent but the apartment left much to be desired - very poor state of maintenance.,0
The host was eager to make us comfortable. Easy to work with. ,1
"The house location is very convienent,easy to find.Evening cold. Micwave and air conditiong did not work well!  ",0
Everything was fine. Jordan was a great and helpful host. Thank you!,1
"It was a great experience, also, great host as well.
It has a very good location near from the metro station.
The host almost was clean the main bedroom the bed was dusty a little bit.
Also, there wasn't a private parking for the car just park anywhere in the street, that one of the main things that let you rethink if you have a car. If you don't so skip this point
Everything else was great.

Thank you",1
Jordan was a wonderful host. He was very kind and unbelievably accommodating when our flights landed early and left late! The space was adorable and clean and fit our needs perfectly! The apartment is extremely close to the T stop which made it convenient for getting around the city. We could not have picked a better spot to spend our time in Boston. Thank you SO much for sharing your city with us Jordan!!,1
"Very nice location and convenient to go to the city using T.Great neighborhood ,convenient stores and places to eat nearby.Jordan is very helpful.Only thing bathroom supplies needed the following day.Overall great stay.Thanks Jordan.",1
Listing description is accurate and the neighborhood is fine. We even did some food shopping at a small local market at 10pm. Good places to eat nearby as well. ,1
"It was really nice for us staying there. Just about 5 min walk to the subway (they call T in Boston), it's so easy to get around. And a quiet neighborhood.",1
This place is very convenient and has 2 big bedrooms and 1 small one. The rooms are very clean and the place is very close to the airport. We stayed for just one day and did not have much communication with Jordan. It is convenient to enter the apartment with the passcode provided by Jordan. The only problem we had was the road noise at night for the rooms on the road side. You might need extra earplugs to be able to sleep.,0
Great,1
"Jordan's place was great! The location was fantastic, walking distance to the airport and to the T. The flat was spacious, comfortable and quiet. It's the perfect flat for a group of traveling friends as it has 2 queens and a single.",1
"Jordan's place was perfect for our group of five. Located just two stops from downtown Boston on public transit and a five minute shuttle bus ride/drive to the airport. Each room had its own air mattress (very comfortable!) - though only the main bedroom had an air conditioner, something to consider for those visiting in the summer. 

Though we didn't get to meet Jordan he made himself totally available for any questions. He even gave us some neighborhood recommendations. Definitely recommend. ",1
Jordan was an amazing host and was very responsive to any questions and concerns we had. He sent us very detailed instructions on how to get in to the place and I found his method to be very organized and easy to figure out. His place is beautiful and kept in the best condition and it looked just like the pictures in the listing. The neighborhood was very safe and overall had a nice feel to it. ,1
The stay was great! The place was exactly how the pictures depicted. The place was conveniently located close to the airport making it easy to catch my flight.,1
"The apartment's description was accurate. A few problems not of our host's making, yet Jason stepped up and made it right. We will return. ",1
"Nice apartment, great location.",1
Great location and cozy apartment. Very close to the airport and Jordan was a good holiday and very responsive. ,1
Jordan was accessible for questions and his place was as described. We had an overall good stay and would recommend to groups of 4 or less looking to stay in Boston on a low budget.,1
"Our host was really good, got back to us at a timely manner when we had questions. The place was nice and comfortable for five people. We had an issue which wasn't the hosts fault but it worked out in the end. But the place was great for being so close to the airport and the commuter rail. We would stay there again :)",1
"The suggestions for restaurants were fantastic.  There is plenty of places close by for groceries, food and laundry.  We found the apartment easily.  Jordan was a great communicator.  The T was only a 5 minute walk with great accessibility to downtown.  It was a great location.  Thank you for a good stay.",1
Jordan was great! The room was conveniently located and checkin was easy to manage. I didn't have any issues and it served our purpose of getting to the airport early in the morning very well!,1
"Jordan is a truly great host. He was easy to communicate and always responded to my e-mails. His apartment was easy to find and what is more important, it was as it was described. Jordan's suggestions about nearby restaurants were priceless, especially for someone who was after 8 hours of journey. If I ever happen to be in Boston again I would definitely like to stay at Jordan's.Thanks!",1
"The location of this apartment is fantastic. Really easy walking distance to the T station at the airport, which leads to the center of Boston in minutes. There's a vibrant city park one block away, and multiple food options are within walking distance. 
We had a short stay, but got exactly what we needed: an easy-to-access place with good, local food nearby.
Jordan was really responsive to our questions and gave simple instructions for checking in.",1
"Very convenient for those who want to live close to airport. Nice and clean rooms. Especially, the host was so kind to write a detailed guidance for guest. I strongly recommend this house to Airbnb users.",1
"Very disappointed doesn't begin to explain how we felt about this trip. Booked for 3 nights and left after 1 (wouldn't have stayed one night if we had somewhere else to go). Dirty grubby apartment with single AC in one bedroom so rest of apartment was boiling, broken TV Screen, kitchen smelt of Gas, broken closet door, cracked tiles in bathroom that smelt damp, filthy stairs carpet, and dirty paint work.

Manged to get part of our money back (less than 50%)for canceled nights but only after several phone calls. Host was more interested in Airbnb cancelling booking so he could re let it rather than resolving our issues.

I have the pictures and would of posted them on my review but cant upload them despite the AirBnB review pages saying you can upload them. Not impressed
",0
"Good description provided to locate and access apartment. Was indeed close to airport as advertised, this was important to us. Besides that we were disappointed. Found it difficult to find a car park close to apartment. One air conditioner in main bedroom meant rest of apartment was quite hot. Floors were not level which was a bit disconcerting as was the weak gas smell in the kitchen. TV had a big crack through the screen. Thought about moving out after first night as it was not satisfactory for my family with three young children.",1
"Jordan was great at communicating, no problems there. Apartment was great and clean but did not have central air as stated. there was no ""free"" parking as stated but was actually a nightmare. Would definitely stay again . Family neighborhood.Thank you Jordan",0
"We were on our way out of town on an early flight and this apartment was perfect for us in not having to fight morning traffic. Parking wasn't too tough. The apartment was spacious and as described, and given our really simple needs, just right and a great value compared to staying at or near the airport in a hotel. ",1
Good experience! Recommend! ,1
Jordan was a great host. The apartment was comfortable and clean and he always responded to questions promptly. I would highly recommend staying here!,1
The rental is very convenient to the airport and to downtown Boston.,1
"Nice place in a great location, close to AP and Subway. ",1
"Great location -so close to transit and the airport, and just two T stops from the aquarium! Jordan gave great instructions and his nearby restaurant recommendations were excellent. I stayed here with my two kids and the proximity to transit and nearby playground with water feature were wonderful. Place was as described, nothing fancy but was just what we needed. We did find out that parking IS definitely enforced which was a surprise, but the ticket was still cheaper than parking in the city for our guests. Would stay here again for sure.",1
You can't beat the location if you are traveling through Logan airport. Jordan was great and excellent instructions for check in and out including local recommendations. ,1
"Jordan's place is quite nice. The location is the best: 3-minute-walk to the T and cannot be more convenient if you are coming from or going to the airport with the airport shuttles. Parking is okay. However, there will most certainly be parking enforcement patrolling the area and issuing tickets in the early morning.",1
"Our stay was for one night, but we found it very comfortable and fictional for our needs. Location was good (particularly for those using Logan Airport). ",1
Jordan was very easy to get a hold of and made it an easy stay. The place is in a great location right next to the T line. Would recommend anyone to stay here. ,1
"The apartment is super close to the airport, and that's is perfect if you arrive late. It is as described in the add, also close to the mbta station to go downtown. Jordan is a nice host and he responded promptly when we wrote to him. Positive staying!",1
"Great location and place. The host guidance on food places was right on. Overall, the condo suited our needs and was in easy distance to downtown. ",1
Flat is as describe. Good place to visit Boston. Easy access to airport,1
"We were very disappointed. On the pictures the apartmend looked very nice, but it was dirty, especially in the bathroom an the plankets. There was an aggravating smell in the flat and especially in the staircase. The wardrobes were broken and also the skirting boards.
But Jordan was friendly and accessible at any time.",0
Jordan provided us with all the info we required for a smooth arrival and check-in. The home is perfectly located near the Airport stop on the blue line. We parked across the street and used public transport throughout out visit.  The apartment is well equipped and very clean. I can highly recommend this place for visitors to Boston. ,1
It is a warm and comforting house with all equipment. it's close to the blue line stop and airport so it's super convenient. I love this house ,1
"Description was accurate. The playground/park nearby was great for our kids. It was great to have food recommendations that were close by. Parking was a little tricky, but doable. Only suggestions: hand towels and Kleenex for the bathroom would be great. We were a little concerned about the slight smell of gas from the stove. ",0
"Jordan's place is really handy for getting to and from the airport and was  fine for our one night stop over in Boston.  Jordan was good at communicating and let us stay on an hour over check out.  The house was spacious and like the pictures, however not overly toddler friendly as the floors are slightly sloping.",0
Nice apartment near the airport.  Accomodate 5 of us easily. ,1
"Great experience!   The apartment was immaculate...  fresh linens, towels, soaps, shampoos, conditioners... even had some delicious local artisan chocolates as welcoming gift.  The feel of the apartment had a great feel..... well decorated/furnished and has high ceilings and big window.  The location is very central with lots of local attractions near by.  Jeff was super helpful.  Met me right on time at the building to let me in and give me keys and give me some local recommendations.  A++ experience!  ",1
"The apartment: furnished to a high standard, clean, 2 good sized double rooms (one has a wide window overlooking Washington St, the other has no external window), well supplied with towels, linen, shower products etc. Small kitchen (with fridge cooker toaster plenty of crockery and cutlery)and table for two make up shared area.
Host: Jeff was very helpful in person and by email (as was his business partner Dave). Arrival and departure arrangements worked really well. Very kindly allowed us to store luggage in apartment until the afternoon as we had late flights from Boston. 
Location: great location, just minutes walk from theatre district, Boston common, shopping, riverside restaurants and metro stations. Only downside is that Washington street becomes a bit noisy from early morning. Felt very secure. ",1
"The apartment is great! IT's situated in the lively shopping area  - Downtown crossing. There is a supermarket nearby.Communication with Jeff and getting access to it was very easy. I wish we had known there is no living room though, because it was not clear from the pictures. We were 4 people + a baby, so having some common space would have eased our stay in it. There is also no space for 4 people to dine / have breakfast",0
Excellent place to stay in downtown Boston.,1
"The apartment is very nice with good location and everything was perfect and clean. I totally recommend you to stay there if you want to spend a few days in Boston. Jeff also gave us all types of recommendations about parking,  restaurants,  places to visit etc. I'll come back if I have the chance to :)",1
"It should be more clear from the posting that this is actually a one bedroom and not a two bedroom since the second 'bedroom' is actually a living room with a little bed instead of a couch. If the owner prefers to call it a two bedroom, then they should note that there is no living room or dining room or other space. Also, it should be clear there is absolutely no access by car since the road in front is pedestrian-only. If you arrive by taxi, plan on walking and, if by car, plan on paying to park in a public lot. Finally, the owner might want to mention that there is a massive construction project going on directly in front of the apartment so you should be prepared to listen to construction noise during your stay. Other than those items, it was indeed very tidy as the other feedback mentions.",0
"We were a group of 4 and stayed for 3 days. APARTMENT was clean and the location is fantastic, conveniently located within walking distance to the downtown crossing (train station), great restaurants and the start of the Freedom Trail.

JEFF is very responsive to all our questions and requests. The information packet that had been left for us had a summary of all the attraction and dining options in the area, as well as how to get around using the public transport. It also had clear contact information if we had encountered any problems. 

SOME THINGS TO NOTE. While generally quiet, there were a few instances where we could hear people shouting from the streets at night so this might be a problem for some. Also, there is ongoing building construction across the street - workers would be able to see into one of the bedrooms. This wasn't a problem for us since we stayed over a weekend. Parking might also be a problem but Jeff would be able to point you to a few options in the neighborhood.

OVERALL, we had a great experience in Boston and would definitely recommend staying here =)",1
The host was the best part of the experience. Jeff was extremely responsive and most helpful. The apartment is very well located and is spacious. Bring an extra suitcase so that you can shop till you drop. A great location to base yourself in and explore Boston,1
"Great location, wonderful beds, great communication. We would highly recommend their place to anyone. ",1
"Thank you Jeff for a perfect time! The apartment was pristine. It had everything you could want, even a pack and play for the baby! He also left chocolates, waters and kind bars for our enjoyment. 
We would definitely stay again. Many thanks! ",1
"The host was very welcoming and helpful. They helped us get our bags and left us welcome candies and chocolate. If you have a car like us, there was a garage only 2 blocks away and the host helped us in booking a spot and got us the card access. The apartment was clean and tidy, and the kitchen was fully equiped. It was near downtown crossing, so walking everywhere was very easy. They were very flexible regarding the check-in and check-out; had the apartment ready when we wanted it, and postponed the check-out when we told them about our late flight. The host helped us in all our inquiries. Overall, it was a great experience and we would stay there again. ",1
"After staying in a hotel & with family on this trip,  this apartment was a clean little slice of paradise! We were welcomed by waters, granola bars & chocolate, fresh, white towels & toiletries. The feel is hotel-like since it doesn't appear to be lived in,  but more clean & spacious. The hosts supplied helpful items like an umbrella, a playpen, maps, and a fully-equipped kitchen. The front bedroom can be loud at times with the building construction directly across the street & pedestrian traffic, but the massive window provides a great view & my little ones loved it.  There was a market close by,  so we were able to eat in for a couple meals.  We were within walking distance of Little Italy, so we HAD to eat out on occasion. The Thinking Cup around the corner on Tremont was great too.  This place was expensive,  but so much better than a hotel! ",1
"It's great. We love the apartment. The taxi driver kept on saying ""It's the downtown of downtown"". The apartment is well located and very clean with enough space. We have a child so Jeff is very kind to set us an air mattress. Jeff has a professional service team to wait us until 11 pm. Our first trying of airbnb is amazing.

这是一间小公寓,但住在里面充满了乐趣。它坐落在波士顿市中心的中心。在这次美国之旅期间,这是我认为住过的最像家的地方。即使是迈阿密的枫丹白露酒店(Fontainebleau Hotel)也未曾让我有如此的舒适感。

一切陈设用具都是宜家(IKEA)新购的,非常齐全,风格也很有品味。舒适的大床让我能快速进入梦乡。厨具非常齐全,我甚至还为家人做了两天的早餐。Jeff贴心的为我们在壁橱里准备了各种冲饮,咖啡、红茶。其中还有我最爱的川宁红茶(Twinings),还有2种口味供我选择,真是太棒了!

房东Jeff有一组非常专业的服务团队,让我们在晚上11点也能顺利入住。Jeff的团队还贴心的为我们加了一张儿童床,让我的小侄女有了2个美妙的夜晚。公寓里一切都非常整洁,甚至就连摆放在床头的洗漱毛巾和香皂都摆放的是如此的整齐。这一切都让我觉得非常开心,服务团队真的非常专业。

如果再有机会到波士顿,我一定还会再来Jeff的公寓里做客。",1
"The apartment is beautifully furnished as shown on the photos! Downtown Crossing subway station is right across the street. Both beds are big enough for 2 people. I booked the apartment just one day before arrival and Jeff was very helpful and responsive! 

One trick to get the key out of the keyhole of the inner door downstairs is to push in the round shape part around the keyhole and pull the key out :D",1
"This place was perfect. 
It was within a few minutes walk of practically everything we wanted to see and do. I can't stress this enough, the location is absolutely the best! Restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, Boston attractions, even grocery stores!
Jeff had a key service meet us when  we arrived, the apartment was spotless, and there was guide to explain how everything worked, as well as advice on where to eat etc.
We will definitely be coming back to Boston, and we will definitely be staying here again! 
This was an amazing first airbnb experience.",1
Jeff's description of the apartment is spot on.  We appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and cleanliness of the apartment.  The key service they use is great and allows for easy check-in and check-out.  Thank you!,1
"Starting with the booking, everything was easy. Key exchange was fast and hassle free. Location was awesome and very convenient and close to restaurants and sites. ",1
Jeff was extremely communicated throughout the booking and whilst we were staying in his apartment. The apartment is exactly as it looks in photos and is perfectly located in the centre of boston with really easy access to the transit system. Highly recommended. ,1
"I highly recommend this condo for couples or families who want to sightsee/spend some time in the most historic part of Boston.  My husband and I stayed there with our two grandchildren for their first trip to Boston.  The condo is nicely-appointed with two comfortable bedrooms and a full-size, modern kitchen and and a bath off the hallway for easy access from both bedrooms, so it allowed all of us to have some privacy.  Also, all the conveniences are there - I especially appreciated the coffee supplies, and we could easily have cooked full meals there to save money.   But, as other reviews have noted, the biggest plus is its location - literally just a few short blocks to the Boston Commons & Gardens, the beginning of the the Freedom Trail, The Old State House, Faneuil Hall, and an easy, if slightly longer, walk to the North End.   And, it is just steps from almost any subway line you might need to get to points west, Cambridge, the airport, South Station - you can go anywhere you need from here in almost no time at all.  If you are looking for a pleasant, safe alternative to the sky-high hotel rates in one of the most coveted areas for sightseeing in Boston, this is the place!  Would go back in a heartbeat if I ever need to return to the area for a while.  Also, key exchange was a breeze.  Thanks to the owners for making this place available to our family for what might have been an otherwise unaffordable trip for our family!  ",1
A clean nice place. Location is great. Concur with other comments.,1
Our host was great and very responsive. I would give him a 10 out of 10. We had no problem gaining access to the unit as well as finding our way around. ,1
"Overall the apartment was great, I would stay here again. Great space for our group of 4 and in a great location. It was really nice that he had a professional management company meet us with the keys. We used Jeff's parking spot and could have used a bit more specific info ahead of time on where it was okay to park because some of the garage was marked as reserved - we had to guess but luckily it worked out okay for us. Only complaint about the apartment was the loud construction across the street that woke us up. ",1
The place was lovely to stay and we had a great time. It was very convenient and welcoming. ,1
"Central location close to Public Garden, tourist attractions, transit and about 15 min walk or less to anything. Apartment was very clean and tasteful. Portable crib provided was especially helpful. 

Excellent communication with host. Would most definitely stay here again!",1
"The host was very helpful and accomondating. The location of the place was great. However, if you're driving here, you may want to consider a less central location because the parking spots around the neighborhood are quite expensive. The place was very clean, bright and comfortable. ",1
"Appreciate Jeff working with us on a last minute booking four our family of 5 though we did not meet him personally. His apartment was great, as described, clean and perfect for a family. The only drawback to the apartment it that is in a pedestrian zone. Which is not a problem if you arive via taxi, but if you arrive with a vehicle and are not familiar with Boston streets and traffic, both the key exchange and parking are a challenge. The gentleman that met us with the key went out of his way to meet us at a street corner nearby where we could stop for a minute without being harrassed by the police just getting there was a challenge. He recommended we park in a garage at 33 Arch St. It was probably the closest garage and was walking distance, but a total rip off! We ended up paying $71 for less than 24 hrs in the garage. According to the garage attendant the day starts over at 5am. Had we not pulled into the garage until after 5pm it would have been $10 for the overnight until 5am then hourly after that! Recommend not arriving at Jeff's until after 5pm if you have a vehicle, but most importantly avoid the garage at 33 Arch.

"Great place, and very central location. Clean and nicely decorated, would definitely recommend it. Had a hard time finding something in the area with two bedrooms, but this fit the bill perfectly.",1
"Incredible location, great apartment and wonderful overall experience! 

My husband and I and another couple came to Boston for a friend's wedding. This apartment couldn't have been better. You are dead center in the middle of downtown crossing with shops and restaurants literally steps from your door. We walked the entire city on foot from the apt. The place itself was modern, clean, well equipped and nicely decorated. 

We had taken the red eye from California and arrived extremely early into the city. Jeff's management staff worker, Mike was incredibly helpful. We were allowed access to a storage unit to hold our bags and he graciously met us early for a key exchange. 

I would hands down stay at Jeff's again and definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a true city experience in Boston. ",1
Very nice place. Centrally located. Management was great to work with. Would definitely stay again.,1
"Jeff apparently did a good job to be a host. He provided me lots of information about the area that we visited ahead of our trip. The location is perfect, and the apartment is newly renovated and quiet enough especially of downtown Boston. Highly recommend for first-time Airbnber!",1
Great place! Easy. Worked great for us.,1
Great central location for all of our Boston meetings. Very clean and efficient space.,1
Had an excellent stay at Jeff's condo.  Great location and great place.  I highly recommend the condo to anyone traveling to Boston.  Thank you again for letting us stay at the condo.,1
Great experience. Super location. Flexible and responsive. Place is in a nice building well appointed. Jeff provided us with amenities like water and chocolate on arrival as well as bathroom supplements. Great experience,1
"The place was perfect and I will definitely stay again! It was clean, was in the BEST location, and really was the perfect place to stay for my business trip. ",1
"Jeff was a great host, although we never actually met him--thankfully the key/hosting service he uses (BnB Caretakers) was great. The person who met us was kind and professional and made us feel at home. The apartment was clean, stocked with water and snacks, and the kitchen had everything you could need for a few days or even weeks. The only issue we had was with construction noise at the skyscraper being built across the street. Jackhammering at 6:30am made for a scramble to get checked out in time. This was only an issue in the street side bedroom, so a better insulated window or additional noise pane would make this apartment a great place to stay!",1
"A nice two-bedroom. Interesting commercial building in the middle of Boston Crossing. Centrally located, stores, restaurants, and theater nearby. Easy key exchange. ",1
"The apartment is a little odd, only one room has a window (unless you counting the one between the bedrooms). Inner ""bedroom window"" as we now call it means that if one person has a light on then the other bedroom has their light on as well. 

The mirror in the bedroom is lovely, but only possible to use if you are 7"" tall.

We have a small hunch that a massive train station is nearby and there is a lot of street noise as well. That being said, the bathroom is good and it is in a good central location (here we're referring to the flat, not the bathroom). The lady who gave us keys was nice as well.

This is a flat for business visits, not for vacations.",0
"We really enjoyed our time at the apartment. It was great. Perfect location, clean rooms. What else to say? Absolutely recommendable.",1
Jeff's place was fantastic! In a great neighborhood near tons of shops and restaurants. And just down the block from numerous train lines. The key exchange was also very easy. I'll definitely plan to stay here if I'm ever in Boston again. ,1
"We traveled to Boston with another couple and had originally booked a place in the North End through Airbnb. That booking was cancelled, unexplained, and I'm so glad it was. We loved staying at Jeff's place. Not only was he a very thoughtful host and quick to respond to any inquiries, the place was clean, well-decorated and in a super convenient location in Boston. The place was spacious enough for two couples, with the only drawback being there wasn't much common space to hangout besides our bedrooms. We didn't spend much downtime at the apartment anyway, so it was really not a big deal. We arrived in Boston very late, and there was no problem getting into the apartment. I sent Jeff our itinerary and he plugged in some good recommendations for eating and drinking in the areas we'd be visiting. Hosts like Jeff are the reason I so highly recommend using Airbnb to travel! ",0
We had a great time at Jeff's apartment. The communication worked perfect and really quick. The modern apartment was in the heart of downtown Boston. Perfect location with plenty of food and shopping around. Thanks for this great AirBnB experince!,1
"I had a great experience with this apartment! I stayed here with my husband and parents while touring Boston and the surrounding area and it was perfectly located. Everything was very clean and the beds were comfortable, which was really appreciated after long days of walking around the city! There was also a really nice chocolate bar and some Kind bars waiting for us when we arrived, which was a nice touch. 

We didn't get to meet Jeff personally, but the check-in process was really simple. Jeff uses a company that sends someone to meet you with the key at the agreed upon time. Our flight ended up being delayed, and then delayed further, and then delayed again...I was in touch with the company throughout and they were extremely understanding and accommodating, even when our final arrival time was pushed back to after 10pm. 

The only small downside is that as there is a building being constructed across the street, the front bedroom gets a pretty early wake-up call due to the construction. I recommend putting the lighter sleepers in your group in the other room!",1
"Nice apartment, perfectly located in Downtown Crossing. There's not a lot of common space for hanging out but it's a quick walk to most of Boston's historic sites and right across the street from the T and a lot of shopping options. If your plans are to be out and about in Boston as much as possible, this is a great deal and I would definitely recommend it.",1
"Cute, cozy, clean apartment in a great part of Boston! Easy access to restaurants, shopping, the Boston Commons, and public transportation. Very detailed and helpful intro to the apartment and neighborhood provided by Jeff (in addition to bottles of water and granola bars!). LOVED our stay in this apartment!",1
"It was great, can't complain, Everything was like advertised, would recommend it to anyone traveling to Boston ! ",1
"Jeff was a great host! Great communication before our arrival, great apartment in a perfect location. I can definitley recommend Jeff and his apartment!",1
"This apartment is pretty great- very central location, convenient to public transportation. It was extremely clean and thoroughly appointed with anything you could possibly need as far as linens, kitchen supplies, etc. The information provided about the apartment and the surrounding neighborhood was very helpful, too.

Jeff and the management company he used for the key exchange were quick to respond to messages and easy to work with. A smooth and stress-free experience!",1
"The apartment was very spacious and very clean. It was in a great location in Boston, with most things within walking distance. We were met on arrival and given the keys, and check out was very simple. Would definitely recommend this apartment to friends and family visiting Boston. ",1
"The apartment is very nice and the hosts know how to make you feel welcome. It's in Downtown Crossing, the middle of a shopping area. The street is pedestrian only during the day, so you'll have to walk one or two blocks if you come by cab. Short walk to South Station, Beacon Hill, Chinatown, and not too far from the harbor and North Point. Perfect location for our purposes. Hosts leave fresh towels, soap, shampoos, water and granola bars for you. Everything worked exactly as described. Check in and check out was painless. ",1
"Really good, the location is in the downtown, and you can shopping, find some delicious food near the apartment. It's really comfortable to live here! Strongly recommend!",1
"The apartment is nice and clean. It's very quiet and private(exactly what I want it to be.) The kitchen supplies ran out before we moved in. The apartment is at the very center of Boston, which basically means it's close to everything. I really like this apartment. And I will recommend it to anyone who comes to Boston!  ",1
"The host made us feel very welcome. He has provided complimentary water bottles and candy bars. He also had also provided travel sized toiletries and towels for each guest. 

The location was great and the place was clean. 

Note: entrance to the apartment is on a pedestrian only street, so if you are arriving with your car - you need to park a few blocks away and carry your stuff up from there. ",1
The room was great. I really enjoyed my stay.,1
"Our host sent us messages beforehand to inform us of any issues we needed to know about. He also was gracious enough to let us in a few hours before our scheduled check-in time since our flight arrived early. 

Our host was responsive to emails and made sure that someone was present to meet us at the apartment with keys to get it. ",1
"This is a great apartment and a thoughtful host!  We were greeted on time and given a tour.  There was coffee, tea, bottled water, Kind bars and chocolate waiting for us.  The apartment is actually nicer than the photos.  It's super clean and it's recent renovation was with high end finishes.  It's got a quiet, peaceful feeling.  The neighborhood, Downtown Crossing, is extremely convenient.  The T is a few blocks away. I would absolutely stay here again.  The only thing to keep in mind is that the street is pedestrian only until 6:00.  At that time taxis are allowed on it.  If you're driving research garage parking before you arrive because its pricey.  ",1
"Everything was great! Amazing location, jeff was helpful and flexible, they left us chocolates And granola everything was clean ",1
"Loved Jeff's place. Great location with easy access to all points in the city. Great customer service sets this place apart. I was stuck in Boston for two extra days because of weather and Jeff and staff allowed me to stay during that timeframe and accommodated a late check out. 5 stars!
",1
Plenty of resources provided about the options in the neighbourhood. Easy experience to pick up keys. Great location and overall a good experience.,1
"I will try and stay here next time I'm visiting Boston. The location was perfect, the apartment was spotless and everything ran like clockwork. Getting in was a breeze and the use of space was ideal for myself and my daughter. We walked and or Lyfted everywhere we needed to go for the college tours we came for. Thank you Jeff!",1
"Convenience and location are fantastic! Train stops are across the street as is a full service gourmet market. The apartment is nicely decorated with some furniture gems. Key transfer is easy with the contracted service but be sure to ask for the trick on how to work the sticky building lock. Once you've got that, it's ALL good! ",1
"Amazing apartment , very clean.  Perfect location . If you need to go to Boston, it is the place to be",1
Good location!,1
"Very clean and exactly like the description. 
Apartment comfortable and cute. 

The location itself was very central and moving in Boston from here was perfect!
 The building itself wasn't that great...
",1
"This apartment was fantastic!!! Everything was clean and organized, just as the picture presented. Also the location was perfect!!",1
"The neighborhood was great, shopping on every corner.  The apartment was hotel clean, great choice for Boston.",1
My family enjoyed staying at Jeff's flat in Downtown Crossing.  It was very clean and comfortable.  The location is perfect and within walking distance of the Freedom Trail.  It was our first Air BnB experience and we were truly impressed with everything.,1
listing was just as described. they let us check in early which was a huge help for the meeting we had to attend. they were easy to coordinate with and the location is amazing!,1
"The apartment was great and in a good location.  The beds were comfortable.  There was a pack-n-play available, which would've been nice to know in advance.  I'm guessing a previous guest just bought one and left it.  One thing to note is that there's a window between the two bedrooms (up high, above the closets).  It's not a huge deal but could be a problem people don't go to bed at the same time or if you are trying to put kids down early.",0
"Perfect central location... quiet, clean apartment with all the essentials. Jeff was very responsive when we experienced some wifi issues. Would definitely stay here again!",1
"Jeff's space was so well-appointed! Loved the convenient snacks and travel-size toiletries that were provided, and the kitchen had all of the necessary pots, pans, appliances, and utensils. The location was perfect for exploring the city, right in the Downtown Crossing area. We enjoyed lots of fun restaurants, shopping, and nightlife in the neighborhood. Perfect home away from home!",1
"We had a great stay at Jeff's apartment! My husband and I and our two daughters were in Boston for a week to look at colleges in the area, and the apartment worked perfectly for us. The apartment was just as pictured and had plenty of space for the 4 of us. We had everything we needed to feel very comfortable and the kitchen was well appointed (we ate most of our breakfasts at the apartment). There is a great grocery store just around the corner that has everything you could possibly need. The best part about the apartment is the location. It is located right near several T stops and also is a very short walk to the train station (we took the train to visit colleges in Worcester), so it was very easy to get around without a car. We loved staying right in the heart of the city with so much to see and do. I took my younger daughter to the New England Aquarium on one of the days and we were able to easily walk there. ",1
"A great stay in a clean, well appointed apartment in a bustling part of Boston.
The description was exactly as the apartment turned out to be.
",1
Listing was accurate and someone was waiting for us.,1
"Fantastic location, right in the middle of downtown.  The place was immaculate, the beds very comfortable, and the whole experience was outstanding.  I recommend it without reservation and would absolutely stay there again (and I expect that I will, on future business trips).",1
"Great location and perfect if you fancy a morning run on Boston Common!

Check in was easy with very good comms, would definitely stay again!",1
great place.  exactly as advertised.  exactly what i needed.,1
"Nice decor, comfortable beds. Located right in the heart of the city. Literally above the Gap Factory store. Note that there is no vehicle traffic on the road where the apartment is located so you may have to walk with your suitcases about a block or so. Starbucks coffee was a nice addition. Could have used paper plates and napkins and perhaps a kitchen towel.  Had a slight issue with some late night ""entertainment"" beneath our window at midnight, but I called our contact and security took care of the issue within minutes. Overall very nice experience!",1
I love the apartment. Everything is decorated nicely and kept clean. The location is perfect for convenient access to other locations.,1
"Very good place to stay in Boston. Nice apartment.
Super well organised and spotless clean. Location is very easy and getting around is no problem as you can almost walk everywhere 
We enjoyed it",1
"Amazing location.  Place was just as advertised.  Easy key exchange.  Little details right like bottled water, toiletries, etc.  Definitely would stay again.",1
"The appartement was spacious, very clean and very well located.

At our arrival, someone was there to welcome us and give us the keys.

Good advise for the parking. 

Thanks a lot! Would rent again.",1
The check-in process is very smooth. The room is beautiful and spacious. The best part is its location. It is located right at the downtown which is very convenient to go around.,1
"Jeff,s apartment was smashing !  Central area to stay in, greatly equipped - perfect for a city break.
Would definitely recommend!
We got stuck in traffic so arrived much later than expected.  The lady who was greeting us was very understanding and easy to keep updated with re our arrival!
Hope to be back.  Loads more to see !",1
"This apartment is in a perfect location! Central to north end, south end, beacon hill, Boston Commons and the Freedom trail!!
The beds were cozy, the shower nice and the kitchen stocked with equipment. The market was literally around the corner- once at the location(it's downstairs!), and mostly quiet.
I recommend bringing earplugs though it's mostly quiet- I could hear workmen across Washington St and a neighbor in their kitchen my first morning... Neither a big deal but feel the need to mention.
Also, there is no living room. We were out and about most of our stay, so this was not a problem for us. We found the space comfortable and met our needs nicely!
We would return, for sure!",1
Very clear and prompt communication. The management company was very accommodating. The apartment was clean and tidy and the location is incredibly convenient to all downtown spots and for accessing the surrounding areas.,1
"If you are visiting Boston and want a convenient, beautiful place to stay - this can't be beat. The apartment is exactly as listed - gorgeous and newly renovated. It had all of the amenities expected and more. The host did an excellent job making us feel welcome - they left snacks and water and a nice packet describing the area and things to do. I would definitely use this apartment again.",1
"Right at Downtown Crossing this is an excellent location. The rooms were very clean. There were treats and water to welcome us. The view was great. Communication was timely and the meet up to get the key went smoothly. I would definitely stay here again as it was safe, comfortable and centrally located.",1
Nice apartment in tall building along a major shopping area. Stayed two nights for a conference and fit the bill well. Close to the park and transit. ,1
"My friend and I stayed at Jeff's place for 3 nights and overall the stay was just OK. Based on the other reviews I think we had some bad luck - the key pick handover was a bit confusing and required a lot of communicating/effort on our part and when we arrived one of the bedrooms had a slight but bothersome smell of cigarette smoke, which lingered there for most of the visit.  I communicated all of this with Jeff and to his credit he was very responsive and accommodating. He offered to send a caretaker to clean the place but by that point we were most of the way through our visit and decided to just clean the room ourselves. Honestly, I think this was more of an issue with Air bnb service/handlers. On the place itself - the place is as described and in a convenient location. I will say that the walls are pretty thin so one can easily hear noise from other tenants. Not the biggest deal for me as I am a deep sleeper but bothersome for my friend. 

Overall OK visit and while we would not stay here again I would say that the fact that most of the reviews are positive means that we likely had some bad luck. Again, Jeff is great and I am sure he is working to ensure that the issues we had will not happen with other guests.",0
The apartment was incredibly clean (and comfy!) and in a great location. The management company was super accommodating with adjusting my check in/check out time and answering all of my questions. Would definitely stay here again. ,1
Great location!  Close to a nice grocery store.  The rooms are clean and good size for my family.  Good choice for Boston. ,1
"The apartment was clean and equipped well . The apartment was in a secure building at the heart of the city . Close to the shops , near the subway . Everythig was near to us . 
Some forks were missing our host send us immediatly. there were clean towels and soap shampoo in the apartment .
With the 2 king size beds we comfortable . Only one bed was a little bit short for the tall peaple. 
Very good apartment for Boston . If I go Boston again I will stay again in this apartment . 
Every thing was very ok .
Thak u dear host .
",1
"We had a fantastic week staying in Jeff's apartment in Boston! The apartment itself is situated smack bang in the middle of the city, absolutely everything is within walking distance.
The apartment was bright and spacious for our needs with a new kitchen which was stocked with drinking water for us on arrival. The management company we engaged with were very accommodating in our check in and check out, they met us early to facilitate a bag drop and managed to get us a late check out when we were leaving. We would definately recommend staying here for a visit to Boston!!",1
Perfect location to jump on the freedom trail and explore historic Boston sites. Very clean and comfortable apartment. Super cold air conditioning in the middle of July was very welcome. Despite the urban location it was very quiet in the apartment and we slept great! Parking is a challenge.,1
Excellent location and really nice apartment! Contact with the host and the caretaker company was perfect. Highly recommended! ,1
"This place was awesome! Fantastic location, beautiful apartment, complete with towels, shampoo, and some food! Getting in and out was super convenient, parking was close by and the apartment is walking distance to literally everything you want to see in Boston. Thanks Jeff for a wonderful first Air BnB experience, we would stay here over and over again :)",1
This was a great place to stay in Boston. We would have needed two hotel rooms so this was better value and it was useful to have a kitchen as we were travelling with our baby. I don't think it was advertised but there was a travel cot in the apartment which was handy. Check-in was easy and the location was perfect. We were able to walk pretty much everywhere we wanted to see. I'd definitely recommend the apartment. ,1
Great apartment! Super comfy bed. Right in the thick of it in Boston. ,1
"Pleasant stay in downtown Boston, everything walk distance. Nice supermarket with everything you need in next street. Description and pictures perfectly in line with the reality. ",1
"Jeff's place pretty much was the best among all places my family have stayed during our 20 days of a all-over-the-US trip. Perfect location to experience Boston right from its heart, while convenience for either foods or shopping or traffic providing you with a cozy stay. 

The place is super clean and perfectly equipped even with snacks as a welcome, and the bright view as well as comfortable beds are definitely are a big bonus. The check-in was smooth despite the fact that we arrived an hour earlier than our set-up time. 

The only problem was the bathroom door which locks itself due to the unchanged broken handle from outside, but the management team and especially Jeff himself were really responsive and had someone sorted it out even at late hours. We really appreciate it!",1
"Jeff's place in downtown crossing could NOT be in a better location. My daughter and I had a great 5 days. The apartment was comfortable, clean and extra props to the woman who met us (in the middle of the night) to give us the key and orientation. We were blown away by everything. We highly recommend Jeff's place.",1
"We stayed a few days at Sara's place and we had a very nice time. The neighbourhood is very quiet with a nearby park and great Italian restaurant and bakery just around two corners ;)

The room itself is nicely decorated with a spacious bed. Even though there is no real kitchen, there is a microwave, fridge and electric kettle, so it is easy to have a breakfast in the morning. Communication with Sara was very efficient. We can definitely recommend her.",1
I had a very nice stay with Sara. This room is like having your own apartment! It's perfect for a restful evening. Sara also made it very special with a fully stocked kitchenette. I would return in a heartbeat.,1
"We really enjoyed our (unfortunately very short) stay at Sara's apartment! The room is very clean and cozy and Sara put a lot of effort into making it comfortable for her guests: the bathroom and kitchenette are very well equipped, there is lots of information about Boston for tourists and Sara even let us use her washing machine/dryer when we arrived. I would definitely recommend her place!",1
"We only stayed in Sara's basement apartment for one night just before a flight out of Boston, but we had a lovely relaxing time. While the basement is small, the room contains everything you need for a pleasant stay; own bathroom, kitchenette (coffee and tea, microwave, minibar fridge), iron and ironing board, couch, writing desk, TV, and of course a comfortable double bed. The shower is even stocked with a range of shampoos, conditioners and body washes.

We were surprised at how nice the local area was. Take a walk to the waterfront and visit Piers Park on the reclaimed wharf for a great view of Boston, and check out the East Boston Greenway, a strip of park where the old railway used to run. And it's only a single train stop away from the airport in one direction, and the city in the other.

Sara is very quick to respond to emails and is a very gracious host. We would not hesitate to stay here again!",1
"Nice apartment, nice Host!",1
"Nice amenities (tea/coffee in room), bathroom soap dispenser, cosy room. conveniently located near the airport and city centre. ",1
"We stayed at Sarah's place  for 2 nights. The studio is located in the basement of a house. Apartment is very clean, cozy, well-appointed.
Common hallway and stairs in the house a little spoiled impression they are old and not very clean.
In the studio there is no real kitchen, but there is a mini-kitchen: fridge, electric kettle, microwave and coffee machine. 
The bathroom new and clean, well equipped. There's even a first aid kit with necessary details. 
The great advantage of this apartment  is washing machine and dryer. Do not waste time going to laundry!
We were a little scared of information about parking: ""the closest parking  it's valet-parking at the airport."" But it turned out a lot easier! There is a great simple cheap  parking at the nearest metro station. 
All in all it was a good experience and we give a good recommendation! 
 (sorry for my english, all claims to the online translator)",1
This apartment is located very conveniently to both the airport and to all Boston has to offer. Sara was a wonderful host and have us plenty of recommendations of places to visit. She made the space very comfortable and was very quick to respond with any questions we had before and during our stay. I would highly recommend staying here for anyone's visit especially if you are traveling to and from Logan airport.,1
"We had a very pleasant stay in Sara's basement room. She's really made the most of the space, with lovely furnishings, a comfortable bed and plenty of little extra things (such as a book of personal recommendations) that made one feel right at home.

She also helped us out when we ran into some problems that delayed our check out somewhat, and allowed us to stay until we got ourselves sorted out, despite the fact a guest was staying the following night. Little things like that leave a positive feeling.",1
"Had a great one night stay at Sara's. She is the most accommodating hostess, and was incredibly thoughtful and welcoming. The neighborhood is a bit ""in transition"" but is really close to the airport and the room was clean, cozy and comfortable. Great value.",1
"This was a great place to stay if you're visiting Boston.  Only a couple of blocks away from Maverick Station and a 10-minute ride on the ""T"".   Sara was very nice and informative on what to do around the area and the best way to do it.   The only downside was that her place wasn't available the following week when we came back to Boston!  :)",1
"We visited various cities in our holiday and no doubt this was the best apartment. Big enough, beautiful, clean and well cared for! Sara was very nice and accurate and provided us with everything we needed. Located very close to the metro, perfect for exploring Boston.",1
"I was in Boston for a quick overnight stay with a half day of tourist time as part of a long trip and this space could not have been more comfortable, convenient, quiet or ideal. Sara is a most gracious host who has all of her bases covered from coffee in the room to recommendations while in Boston to providing a card for the T (public transit system). For this weary traveler, her hospitality could not have been more welcome. And the room was just perfect!  Thank you so much, Sara.  I hope to see you and this spectacular city again soon!",1
"I was only in Boston for a short while but Sara made my one night stay very comfortable. Her place is very nice and well stocked with many things that a careless packer like me forgot.

If I'm ever in the Boston area again, I know where I'm staying!",1
"We stayed here 4 nights and found it to be comfortable and that it met all our needs.  Sara was warm and welcoming and had many little extra goodies available, such as granola bars and specialty coffees.  It was very quiet because the bedroom suite is in the basement and towards the back.  The only negative was that the stairs down are a bit steep and fairly tricky to manage with suitcases, but Sara did offer to help.  The best part for us was the use of her washer and dryer so we could have clean clothes when we got on the cruise ship at the end of our stay there.  The other perk was the Italian Express Pizzeria just around the corner.  They have an extensive menu, not just pizza, and everything we had (2 nights we ate there) was delicious, with huge servings.  Share a salad and an entree and you will be full!  The subway stop at Maverick Square is very convenient, and getting a pass makes it all very easy - you can get everywhere on the subway.  We also did 2 walking tours using Free Tours On Foot, and they were so excellent.  All you do is tip at the end.  Look at their tours online.  We also enjoyed the Sam Adams Brewery tour, with 3 big beer tastes at the end - free.  ",1
"This was the perfect spot for us to relax and crash for the night. Sara was very friendly and accommodating. The suite has a separate entrance from her apartment so we didn't feel like we were intruding at all- very private. There are a lot of materials on local attractions as well as toiletries and breakfast supplies on hand. We found this area to be safe yet still full of local flavor, not at all like an anonymous hotel! It was an easy trek to the T. The bed is nice and firm. I would recommend this for anyone looking for an economical and pleasant place to stay. ",1
"Great little place, very close to downtown and close to transport and the airport. Sara was very accommodating and friendly and provided some good tips for what to see. Would definitely recommend Sara's place to others.",1
"Sara's place was great. Clean, quiet and convenient to transit. Sara was really helpful with things to do around Boston. I highly recommend staying here and would not hesitate to stay again. ",1
Sara's place is beyond accommodating and filled with all the essentials you sometimes miss at home. She was incredibly flexible with my check-in time and she could not have been more informative in answering any questions I had with travelling around Boston. Thanks for a wonderful experience!,1
"Sara's flat was very convenient, private & comfortable. I would stay there again without hesitation.",1
"I loved staying at Sara's place. It was private and cosy. I liked that she had a tv as well. The place looks exactly like the photos. It was clean and comfortable. Her place is so close to the airport and to the subway, which made commuting incredibly convenient. Sara also left great detailed check in instructions. I would definitely stay here again. ",1
"I stayed at Sara's place for the first night of a weekend visit to Boston.  It was exactly as she described, no surprises (in a good way).  Basement, but clean comfortable and cute. Excellent proximity to the airport I had a comfortable stay and would certainly recommend.",1
"My friend and I made a last minute trip to boston and needed a place to stay. Sarah was very helpful and accommodating. The check-in and checkout process was very simple, and the place was very close to the airport. Would stay with Sara again if in Boston and highly recommend her place.  ",1
"Sara was an excellent host, very informative of surrounding areas and accommodating of her guests.  The suite was exactly as described and perfectly located.  Be sure to check out KO at the Shipyard for some yummy meat pies, that was probably my favorite walk (sunset across the skyline) out of the whole trip.",1
Sara did a great job. Never seen such a well prepared room with many little things a guest might have forgotten for the trip but which are as well simply helpful like the tea and coffee selection. Sara prepared as well a list of sights worth to see in Boston with additional information - very well done. The walls are a bit paper thin. I did not have any problem with that but anyone who wants to hear music or watch TV a bit louder or talk late at night might opt for a place with better walls to prevent to bother neighbours.,1
"Suite as advertised...location could not have been more convenient to airport or downtown.  Located in a working class neighborhood with transportation, coffee, restaurants, small markets and stores.  Sara met me and introduced the suite and the environs.  She provided much info for making my stay fun.  Very comfy.  Beware of narrow stairs while carrying a suitcase but that only happens twice.  Thanks Sara.",1
"Hello, this was my first experience using airbnb.com and due to such a great service I had at Sara's I will be using this website again. I stayed here from Nov. 29th till Dec. 4 and did not have any problems. Omg... the room was cute and cozy which made you feel right at home =) It was honestly close to everything and if you ever need help with anything you can count on Sara. I stayed here with two other friends and we all slept in the same bed 
(because we decided to, there is also a couch that converts to a bed) which the bed was extremely comfertable and the bathroom was clean with fresh towels!! The little fridge, microwave, dryer, and washer was convenient for us. The only thing I recommend for anyone is that if you are going to be driving around do not count on your gps from your phone..... that was our only little problem.I highly recommend Sara's place to anyone looking for a quiet comfortable room in Boston =) Thank you Sara and Boston was AMAZING!!! =D",1
"Clean, attractive space with a thoughtful host who was easy to work with. Thanks, Sara!",1
"Superb room in a perfect place. The neighbourhood is quiet, and really closed to the subway. The room was clean and well fitted as well as the bathroom and little kitchen. Highly recommended to visit this beautiful city!",1
"The place a a couple of stations away from the airport. Sara is a nice host, very thoughtful of all details.",1
"Great location, especially if you're flying from Boston Logan! Great host. Great room. Really comfortable. All the services and facilities of a 4 star hotel (and more - free wifi!). Sara did a great job of accommodating our needs. She was always reachable. Recommended.",1
"Really great place to stay when you travel for a few days at Boston! Strong recommended! Convenient transportation, only a few minutes walk to the nearest subway station, and you can always find food and snacks nearby. Also, Sara is a really nice host, considerate and caring. Anyway, you would love to spend few days here!",1
"We had a great three nights stay in Sara's little basement suite.
Sara had thought of many helpful details like coffee, shampoo and her list of things to do in Boston. The place is in East Boston and if you walk outside and down the street you have a magnificent view of the Boston skyline from the other side of the water. Also it was really easy to get from Sara's place to the airport the last early morning.
",1
"We stayed at Sara's place for 4 nights and it was a wonderful experience. Sara made herself easy to contact, and was very accommodating. Her place was clean, cozy, and so convenient to get to the subway. We will definitely be staying at her place again the next time we visit Boston.",1
"Sara's apartment was really conveniently located - just a short subway ride into downtown. The apartment was very nice and spacious, with a big bed, private bathroom, and many bathroom supplies (hairdryer, lotion, cotton balls, etc). I definitely think it is worth the money! The hosts were very nice as well :)",1
Great place in convenient vicinity to Logan Airport! Sara was considerate and friendly. We enjoyed our stay!,1
Sara could not have been more accommodating as we are standby travelers and we have a difficult time knowing the exact dates needed or times of arrival - she went out of her way to work with us. Her place is as described and could not be any easier to get to from the T - only one stop from the airport. Thank you again Sara.,1
"The room was just as pictured, very lovely! Sara was very accommodating and offered me the opportunity to leave my luggage there before check-in time. The closet revamped into a mini-kitchenette is such a great idea! I feel right at home in her place.",1
Sara was awesome! I highly recommend a stay here. Its close to the airport and the T. Thank you Sara and we will be staying here on our next stay in Boston! ,1
"Sara's place was very convenient for us during our 3 day stay in Boston. It's very near a Maverick T stop, with a great Italian restaurant within walking distance. ",1
"Great place with easy and fast connection to the airport as well as downtown Boston. Everything was clean and as expected from the description and pictures. I was able to store my luggage during the day after check-out as my flight was in the evening. 
I can recommend this place for your Boston trip!",1
"Sara's suite provided a great home base for myself and a colleague. We were in Boston on business and stayed 3 nights. Sara was extremely welcoming and kind. She showed us all the amenities of the bedroom, and even suggested great spots in Boston for photography. The room also featured a well-organized binder filled with information, sights-to-see, etc. In sum, Sara is a very prepared and knowledgeable host with a passion for Boston.

In terms of location, Sara's home is great. Down the street is a park on the water with an incredible view of downtown Boston and the North End. We spent a good amount of time here collecting timelapses. The drive into Boston proper is maybe 10-minutes. Just try not to get lost on Boston's collection of bridges, tunnels, and overpasses.

A couple of moot points for us were the size of the room. When the sofa bed is out, the room becomes a bit tight. Add 2 people and 4 pieces of luggage, and you are in for a squeeze. Luckily, we were able to stow some of our baggage into the hallway. Otherwise, walking around would have been a bit of a tetris game. Also, parking is not easy (especially in the snow). Be prepared to circle the block a couple times if you plan on staying out late.

My only other feedback for myself. It's not easy to keep the tile floors clean when the world outside is covered in snow. We did out best to clean up after ourselves. Hopefully, we did not cause too much extra work for Sara.",1
"My boyfriend and I had a wonderful stay at Sara's apartment. It is in a great location for getting to/from the airport and also to/from Boston. The actual apartment is great as well. It has everything that we needed, and even a surprise closet with a fridge, coffee, etc. She also had phone chargers available in case you forgot yours and all sorts of information on what to do in Boston. I would stay here again and again. Thanks, Sara!",1
"My boyfriend and I stayed here for President's Day weekend/Valentine's Day. This stay was everything we had hoped for and more! The room was absolutely adorable and looks EXACTLY like the pictures. It was a VERY short walk from the T, and it was close to the airport which made traveling with lots of luggage much easier. Sara was a great host. She very thoroughly explained everything and was very inviting. We kept very much to ourselves, but we really appreciated her hospitality. 

I cannot overstate how great this whole experience was. I hope we get the pleasure of staying in her adorable home if we come back to Boston!",1
"Lovely spot, very close to Logan and public transportation.  Great base for exploring Boston!  I second the other glowing reviews here.",1
"Sara's place was perfect! We were hoping to have a fun night in the city before catching an early flight the next morning and Sara's suite is perfectly appointed for a nice stay. The room suite is completely segregated from the rest of the house and everything was exceptionally clean. Sara was nice enough to have the bathroom fully stocked with any toiletries we may have forgotten en route, which is just a very thoughtful touch and indicative of someone that really knows how to be a host. Would definitely stay there again!",1
"Very comfortable bedroom suite near Logan.
Sara worked with my uncertain time of arrival, to ensure I could get in even when she could not meet me there personally.
It's actually within reasonable walking distance of the airport: ~a mile and a quarter, depending on the terminal. With no luggage to speak of, I made it each way in under 25 mins. Bonus: a bit of brisk exercise in the 18 degree early March air!",1
"Sara's Suite was the perfect stop for our one night in Boston, with plenty of room for the three of us! Sara's mom was visiting from out of state, and was there to greet us and get us acquainted with the space when we arrived, the kitchenette was fully stocked with an excellent coffee selection, and the beds were super comfortable - even the pull-out! Thanks again for a great experience! ",1
"Sara's place was in a great convenient location in Boston.  The walk from the metro to the place was close and the check in was smooth.  The place was tidy and there were enough amenities provided.  Although it was in the basement, it still had natural light and felt comfortable.  There was enough space for 2 people.  It was a in a quiet location.  I would definitely stay here again when I am in Boston again!",1
"My sister and I stayed here for 4 nights.   We arrived before check-in time but Sara was very accommodating. Her Mother was in town and she let us drop off our bags and pick up keys.   The room is just as it is pictured. Very cute and
Comfortable.  Sara had a great supply of coffee and  instant oatmeal for is and the fridge and microwave came in handy. 
Our walk from maverick Station was 5 minutes max. So convenient to get everywhere on the subway. 
Our first meal was at Italian Express which one block up and over. Tripadvisor said it was the #10 place to eat in ALL of Boston!  It was super good and affordable. And they deliver!

One thing to note is that the stairs to your room are very narrow and steep. Neither of is had a full size suitcase and it was a good thing. Maneuvering our bags down and then up the stairs was the only challenge of our stay. 

Overall this was a great value and a wonderful  place to stay. ",1
"Sarah was a great host, the place was private and cozy. I loved how it was so close to the subway station and that made it easy to get around the city.",1
"Great way to know Boston! Sara had everything in the house to receive us well, even some tips for tourists.
Tks Sara!",1
"Sara responded to all messages very swiftly. Her location is very convenient to get to from the airport. I especially appreciate all the extra conveniences you might not expect from a smaller place (e.g., small refrigerator and kitchenette area, laundry).",1
"Excellent place. Great location. Close to airport. Flying in from the uk it cost us less than $10 to get a cab to Sara's place. Also just a 2-3 minute walk to the nearest metro station, 2-3 stops to get downtown. So easy. 
Sara really has gone the extra mile with lots of little thoughtful extras that you might need on your trip; a range of toiletries, teas, coffees, oatmeal, fridge, microwave and laundry facilities etc, as well as a very helpful file full of tips and advice for sightseeing. 
The basement apartment is cosy and so quiet and peaceful. 
Thank you Sara. 

Dan & Catherine",1
"The place was easy to get to. Sara checked us in. She was very welcoming. If u plan to stay in the apartment for a longer period though, it is noisy and the Internet is really slow. Other than that, it was good.",1
"We stayed here after a flight in to Boston (it's pretty close by the airport and cheaper than a hotel!).  The room was really nice, clean and Sarah was really helpful!  Only stayed one night, but overall had a good experience and would recommend it over a hotel for a quick stay!

",1
"This was our second Airbnb experience and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Sara's.  We arrived from Logan Airport on the subway, all instructions and arrangements were so easy to follow.  Communication with Sara is excellent.  Sara's sister met us and very kindly let us leave our luggage before checking in as we were early. 
We met Sara later that evening, she was very friendly and welcoming. The apartment is lovely and clean and very convenient for Boston (one stop away on the subway - which is only a short walk from the apartment) and there are local shops nearby if you need anything.  However, we only needed milk as Sara  had thought of everything to make our stay enjoyable.  
You must visit the local park which is a few minutes walk away from Sara's, as the view of Boston's skyline is amazing!  (NB the park was closed after 10pm).  Sara also let us leave our luggage after check-out as we had an evening flight.  
We found the neighbourhood and apartment very quiet would recommend staying at Sara's.  
Thank you Sara for a comfortable stay!
Helen and Paul from England

"Wonderfully easy and pleasant experience. Sara was very pleasant and hospitable. She met us upon check-in, explained all the ins and outs of the place, and gave us a lot of info on how to get around town. She also provided basic necessities (bathroom supplies, laundry supplies, etc) in case we forgot to pack them. Room was clean and exactly as described.  We only stayed for one night, but it was still a great experience.",1
In Boston for just one night and Sara's place was a great pick--super accessible with great amenities. Sara herself was always reachable and a very considerate hostess. ,1
"We enjoyed our stay.  Sara was a gracious hostess.  The extra little touches (like coffee and instant oatmeal in the room, and soap and shampoo in the bathroom) were much appreciated.  The room is close to the ""T"", though you do need to ride the subway to do anything.",1
Sara was a great host.  Her apartment is very nice and clean and in a great location. We would definitely stay there again.,1
Sara wasn't around to greet us but she left a lock box on and talked me through the getting into the apartment and everything that I would need. She had a comprehensive binder of pretty much anything you would need to know about the apartment or Boston/getting around. The location was great! A few minutes from Maverick Station which from there was no more than 10-15 minutes to get downtown Boston. Everything was clean and prepared. I would definitely stay again. ,1
"Sara was very accommodating to my schedule and provided a comfortable, clean, and enjoyable stay. The location is highly convenient to Logan, and was a perfect place for an early morning flight. ",1
"Sara's place was great for our one night stay. The bed was very comfortable and the space was very clean and pleasant to stay at. Definitely somewhere you'll enjoy staying at. Sara herself was very helpful and gave us all the tips we needed to enjoy the area, a great host to interact with for sure.",1
"Sara's place was perfect for our stay in Boston. The room was well sized and had everything we needed, and having access to a washer and dryer was a bonus! Only a short walk to the train station and the detailed guide Sara provided was helpful in planning our days. ",1
Sara's apartment was absolutely perfect for my weekend stay in Boston!,1
"Sara was perfect : very kind and helpful. Her place is desirably situated : very close to Maverick subway station (5' by foot) and then close to the Airport, to the Aquarium, to downtown Boston. The appartment is well fitted : kitchen area, bathroom, washing machine and dryer available ! Sara's appartment was the right place to discover Boston. Thank you so much Sara ! Cyril, Anne-Sophie and Thomas",1
"This was a great place to stay!  Sara is an incredible host!  The apartment was extremely clean and stocked with everything we needed.  Sara has a helpful book of places to eat, cabs, and other accommodations.  I would certainly stay here again and would recommend it to my friends.",1
I booked the room for myself and a friend that were travelling together. I ended up staying elsewhere but my friend had a positive experience staying at Sara's. I personally found her to be very nice in our text and email conversations and she was very accomodating given my friend and I's changing plans. ,1
Sara was awesome and super friendly!  My husband and I REALLY appreciated her book of things to do along with the take out menus.  Her unit is extremely close to the T and it was very easy to get to Downtown Boston as well as to the airport. I really appreciated the fridge!  We would definitely stay again when back in the area.,1
"Sara's suite is definitely a great location for the airport. A $10 taxi ride or one stop on the T. Since we were returning from a month in Europe, our suitcases were pretty heavy. We used a suggestion from an earlier post and left our largest suitcase upstairs because the stairs are fairly steep. The room has lots of space,comfortable bed, good wifi, tv and even a mini kitchen with microwave and electric kettle. There is a private bathroom also. Sara is very organized and helpful. It was an easy place to stay for our layover. ",1
"I just needed a place to spend the night for my overnight layover. Sara's place was perfect. Very comfortable bed, and cozy apartment. True b&b - I appreciated the coffee and instant oatmeal in the room, and soap and shampoo in the bathroom. TV with Direct TV was a nice bonus. The room was very convenient to the airport, and just a very short walk to the ""T"". Sara was a great host, she met me at the door and made sure I was comfortable before she left.",1
"Sara was a great host. The room looks exactly like the pictures. Our flight arrived around 10:30pm and Sara met with us to give us the keys and gave us a lot of information about Boston. The room is very close to the airport - we took a cab there and it cost us 8$.  Its also very close to a Tstation and very easy to get downtown.  There was also oatmeal, coffee and tea available for breakfast which was nice. ",1
"Sara very friendly and helpful on arrival and had book of recommendations and a map which we found very useful.  2 mins walk to Maverick train station which is 1 stop from Aquarium, from which all of downtown is walkable.  Nice and quiet neighbourhood.  Porridge and bathroom toiletries appreciated.  We were going to the airport and just strolled around to Maverick and picked up a $10 taxi there, 5 min drive away.  Thanks Sara.",1
Sara was easy to get in touch with and very accommodating. We enjoyed our stay at her place. Her place was conveniently located to the subway (blue line). ,1
"Sara was out of town and her sister Julia was the one who met us. Julia is very nice. She took our luggage in as we arrived in the early morning and arranged a time for us to come back later for check-in. 
The house is close to a T station and easy to get downtown or to the airport. The room looks exactly like the photos. It has a queen bed, a sofa bed, a private bathroom, a mini kitchen and good WiFi. We appreciated the instant oatmeal, the washing machine and the dryer.",1
"We were only here for one night, but our experience was great. I arrived quite late at night but Sara's sister was very friendly and happy to let me in and help me out. There is a lot of useful information, and the apartment itself is very cozy. Very close to the airport and T, the neighbourhood seemed alright but we weren't there long enough to get to know the area. I would definitely recommend staying here, especially if you need to be close to the airport. ",1
Sara was great! Very helpful and hospitable. Definitely would recommend working with her to anyone.,1
"Sara was very helpfull and welcoming. She was waiting for us even when we arrived late in the night. She gave us maps and tips about the city. 
The bedroom is perfect for the night and the space is really cute. The Maverick stop for the metro is around 2 min walking and take you to downtown Boston really easy and fast and you have plenty of places to eat and have a drink around the block.",1
"I only stayed for one night, but Sara's place was very comfortable, and had everything that I (URL HIDDEN) particular, I appreciated the mini-fridge (for some Allagash beers I had picked up earlier in the day!), quick wifi, and recycling bin.  The washer and dryer was also a nice touch, though I didn't have to use it.  Though there was no air conditioning, a box fan was provided, and the temperature was very pleasant with the window open (quiet neighborhood!) and the fan running.  Very close to Logan airport, Maverick ""T"" station, and just a short walk away from the East Boston ""Piers Park,"" which offers stunning views of the city, especially at night.  Sara was an excellent host...very communicative before the stay, and very welcoming and gracious upon my arrival.  I would highly recommend staying here!",1
Thanks for the great stay Sara. Everything was as expected. Easy access to downtown via the T. Very private room (including private entrance) and kitchenette area were a bonus.,1
"Sara was a great host and we loved our stay at her apartment during our time in Boston. Before we arrived, she answered any questions that we had quickly. The apartment is just as it appears in the pictures and ultimately it is your own place as it has a separate entrance to Sara's apartment. The bedroom was lovely and we really appreciated the fridge and tea/coffee facilities for breakfast. The location of Sara's apartment is perfect, it is literally a 2/3 minute walk to the Maverick subway stop (one down from the airport) and the next stop on is Aquarium, from which you can walk basically anywhere in the city. The street was lovely and quiet, which we really appreciated after a long day of sightseeing! I would most definitely recommend Sara's apartment to anyone wanting to stay and explore Boston. ",1
We stayed in the room with 3 people and it was very comfortable and nice. Sara was very friendly and helpful. The room is so close to the station which makes it perfectly easy to get around in Boston. Definitly would come back! :)  ,1
"Our host Sara was very friendly and made us feel at home straight away. The location was excellent as it was only 2 minutes from the T station and very close to both the city and the airport.

The apartment was comfortable and spacious although the night we stayed was quite hot and there was no air conditioning.  ",1
"Sara was great host and puts a lot of effort in making the guest comfortable. Clean, quiet place in quiet neighborhood. Not too much in terms of nightlife in neighborhood but very easy to get to downtown and is super easy to get to and from airport. Would definitely recommend renting from Sara.",1
Sara thinks of everything to make a stay in Boston easy and pleasant!  The suite is close to public transportation and easy to find.  Having the Charlie Card ready for use and all the information to read was so nice!   The suite is pleasant and the bed comfortable.  Thank you!,1
"Sara was a great host with a great place that is soooo conveniently located 10 minutes from the airport. She was also very cool to greet us at the door and show us about her apartment.

The apartment itself is comfortable, cozy, and functional where another place of a similar size would be cramped. Great care was taken to ensure we had everything we need, including a home-made booklet that provided useful information such as nearby attractions organised by price.

I would totally recommend Sara's place to anyone visiting Boston for any length of time.",1
"Sara's room is just like the photos and near the metro station so it's really comfortable room. Sara is a kind host and I think washing machine and dryer are really nice service(even powder!). Only one thing I didn't like is that it's located in a basement so I could feel the smell of basement a little bit and couldn't get sunshine in the morning. Overall, it was fine place:) ",1
"My experience with Sara was great, she was extremely helpful! The neighbourhood was perfect, nice and close to a T-stop and to the airport. The apartment was just perfect.",1
Sara is a fantastic host. She has thought from the perspective of a traveler and provides for needs with careful attention. The close proximity to the airport and quiet neighborhood make it a fine place to stay. There are numerous restaurants within a short walk. I went to the Tacqueria Cancun and it was great. The metro system is easily accessible and proved to be the best way to get back to the airport.,1
"Sara's place is great. A perfect base for exploring Boston. The skyline views (a couple of minutes walk from the front door) are incredible, especially at night. The T train, a 5 min walk away, is one stop away from the action and super easy and cheap to use. 

Sara is a fantastic host. Everything you could need, she's thought of (and has provided). Would certainly recommend. We're a bit sad she already has a booking for our return stop. All round winner. :)",1
"Sara was great from the first time we communicated. Helpful, accommodating, thorough, she made sure we had everything we needed, and made herself available in case we had questions. 
We stayed for just one night. The apartment is a good size, the bed is comfortable, and her place is just a few minutes' walk from the T.",1
"We spent one night at this apartment and had a great experience. The host was very accommodating with a flexible check-in time and gave us a detailed tour of the place and information about the surrounding area when we arrived. The description was very accurate, we selected it for the proximity to the airport and it worked out perfectly, we had a nice dinner in the neighborhood in the evening and a short trip before departing Boston in the morning.",1
"Although we didn't meet Sara personally, she gave us good instructions how to get in the house. There was also a folder with suggestions of places to visit and where to eat (or order food). The space is a bit musty, because it is in the basement. I missed the possibility to open a window and get some fresh air going through the room.   ",1
Great time had in Boston by both of us. Sara was really welcoming. She showed us around and had a basket full of maps and things to do which was really helpful. She also had a washing machine and dryer which was especially helpful to us as we had a few clothes that needed washing. There was also a TV and some DVD's left in case we fancied watching films. All in all the stay was really good. Would recommend it highly.,1
"We only stayed at Saras place for one night, but it was very nice, clean and comfortable. She is also very nice and friendly and it was very nice to stay at her place. We would recommend her to everyone.
It is also very close to the T and very close to her place you have some beautiful places were you can see Boston.",1
"Sara was very helpful with useful tips of how to get around and well organised with introducing her apartment. The location is perfect if you need to get to the airport quickly as well as downtown. Well equiped with eminities, comfortable and clean. We will definitely be staying here in the future if ever back in Boston.

Best regards, Carol & John",1
"Sara was an incredibly welcoming, thorough host. She made our first Airbnb stay comfortable, safe, and enjoyable. She gave us the information that we needed to navigate the city. The location was convenient to the train line and to the airport. The space was quite comfortable for two people and had all of the things that we needed (coffee, fridge, toiletries, etc). We would recommend staying with her. ",1
"If you really want to experience the Boston lifestyle you should choose this place. It was super comfy , cozy and cute. Sarah was a phenomenal host & her sister was super helpful. We felt so welcomed as if we had gone to Boston to stay with family. Sarah gave us lots of info as to get around the city and the place is very close to the airport. We caught a taxi to arrive to the airport for about $8. Loved staying at Sarah's home. ",1
"We really like to stay at Sara's accomodation. We've never met her in person but her mum showed us around and was very nice and helpful. The room is really big and nicely decorated, the bed very comfortable and you have also your private little bathroom.
The location is really great: Its near the airport and near Boston city center and there is also a very nice park (5 minute walk) where you have the best view of Boston's skyline. 
We would definitely recommend this accomodation! ",1
We had a great stay in East Boston. Sara's place looks just like the pictures and was exactly what we were expecting from her description. Sara was friendly and helpful in greeting us and making sure we were all set. I was most impressed with how she was flexible with our arrival and departure times. She was very accommodating! ,1
"Sara is a wonderful host ! She was very responsive and helpful from the  booking to our departure. She even wrote tourism advices on the surroundings and collected map and information leaflet on Boston.  Her appartement is great, comfy and really separated from the house. 
The location is perfect, very close from the metro and the airport. Just the perfect location to explore the city !

I really hope Sara's place will be available if I come back to Boston :)",1
"Our flight was very delayed, and Sara was very accommodating.  She gave very thorough instructions so we were able to get in smoothly.  We were only in the space for about 8 hours, but we were pleased with our time there.",1
Love that the location was so close to a park and the T. Easy to get to around especially to the airport. Sara was a great host and provided easy access to all the information that will make your stay in Boston easy.,1
"Sara was very accommodating with the check in and check out times. She is very friendly and provided lots of maps and books on things to do in the city. Everything looks as it appears in the pictures. The apt is very close to the T with a short walk. The neighborhood itself seemed a little sketchy, we didn't want to walk from the T back to the apt late at night so we took an Uber cab which was really inexpensive. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend to anyone who needs to be close to the airport.",1
"Sara was a pleasure to work with and the apartment is super cute and comfortable.  We stayed just one night in order to be close to the airport but Sara has thoughtfully provided everything a tourist might need.  Maps, books on Boston, a list of local stores/restaurants.  The apartment was quiet and very clean and bright.  It couldn't be in a more convenient location!  A block from the T, one stop from the airport.",1
We had a great time and the location of Sara's place was really convenient to the subway and restaurants. She made many suggestions on where to go and a very helpful folder with a lot of information. The place was very cozy for 3. We would definitely use again!,1
"Unfortunately we did not meet Sara but communicated via text. Sara accommodated our need to leave our luggage at the flat before check in. 
The location was ideal for our early morning flight out of Boston and the T stop at Maverick was an easy walk.
The flat was functional and private. We felt more attention to cleaning was needed.
 It was nice to have a coffee maker, tea kettle, microwave, refrigerator and toaster and Sara provides tea, coffee pods, etc. The wi-fi service was sketchy as we were only able to connect once during our three days there. ",1
We really enjoyed our short stay in Sara's apartment.  She has thought of nearly every detail in setting it up.  It is an short ride on the nearby subway to downtown.  Sara was very responsive in email and very friendly in person.,1
"Unfortunately due to health reasons we were only able to communicate with Sara via sms but those messages and the accommodation she provided was excellent! It was a unique little set-up, offering everything we required for comfort and convenience. Close to public transport and private entry allows freedom to come and go with little or no intrusion.",1
"This was my first Airbnb experience and wasn't sure what to expect. Communication with Sara before our stay was quick and helpful. Her instructions regarding directions, check-in and check-out were clear. Sara greeted us at check-in and showed us around. The accommodations were just as pictured and described in the listing. We only stayed for one night. The space is private and we felt safe. Sara has prepared the space with a traveler in mind, including small touches like a well stocked bathroom, a mini fridge & microwave, and a coffee machine. We walked from the T station to the house in approximately 5 minutes. There are several restaurants within walking distance. The neighborhood and house were quiet at night. The only very minor annoyance was the barking of an enthusiastic dog somewhere in the building early in the morning. ",1
"Sara was beyond nice and very helpful with allowing us to drop off our bags the morning before checkin with a small fee. Her place was clean and very comfortable, perfect for being able to fly out very seems least the next morning. Thank you so much again for our last minute request, the neighborhood was very safe and close to the T. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here! ",1
"We arrived on Friday night to be met by Sara.  Everything was perfect and Sara gave us the full tour of the apartment.   The apartment was a perfect retreat for us and Sara made us feel at home.  It is exactly as described.   As well, Sara gave us a rundown of the area and some good advice on local restaurants.
In fact, there are many excellent restaurants within minutes (walking) from the apartment and don’t forget to go to Maverick Square for some delicious pastries and coffee.
The apartment is very well situated within minutes of the “T”.
We had no trouble parking our car out front of the apartment and since it was the weekend we did not have to worry too much about moving it.",1
Me and my friend stayed to Sara's apartment only one night. The apartment was amazing and Sara is helpful. She's a really good host and person! Thanks for all! ;))),1
Great host! Very accommodating to our late night arrival. Perfect location for travel from Boston-Logan airport. Sara provides additional information for the area to enhance your stay. ,1
"Sara was an awesome host. Unfortunately, I never got the chance to meet her, but she was responsive and very accommodating. The place looks like the pictures and is in an excellent location! She allowed my brother to leave his bags after check out time because he had a later flight. Thanks Sara for an awesome stay!",1
"Sara was very easy to communicate with and responsive over text.  The directions to her apartment were clear and accurate.  The blue line is very close by, and made access to downtown Boston very convenient. The apartment itself was just as advertised: plenty of space, private bathroom, laundry, and kitchenette in the main bedroom closet.  Another great thing about Sara's place: it is right around the corner from beautiful Piers Park, with amazing views of the city, a giant playground for kids, and lots of nice seating to watch the boats go by.",1
"Sara was a very laid-back person and easy to get along with. She gave great instructions on how to navigate the city. The apartment was in a good area close to the airport and close to the train station. Apartment was a good size, especially for two people. I found it difficult to sleep because there was this annoying dog who would bark for hours in the morning. It was also oddly colder in one room than the rest of the apartment.",1
Sara was very welcoming! We were thrilled to have a warmed and cozy room awaiting us after a late flight!  It is exactly as described! Very charming! We will definitely seek Sara out for an AirBnB stay for future Boston trips! ,1
Great location both to downtown and the airport! Small but cozy. ,1
"Sara's place was perfect! It was everything I expected and the street it was on was beautiful! It was in a perfect location, just a short walk to the train station and not even a 5min ride into the heart of Boston. Great place to stay if you are looking for the true Boston feel! ",1
Sara was great!  Her place was clean and easy to find.  The location was very convenient- ~3min from Logan Airport.  She was helpful and helping me find the place- very positive experience!,1
Everything was fine! We didn't meet her personally but due to very good instructions it was very easy to get all things done. Apartment was tidy and everything was ready for us to sleep. We had plenty of room for our group and it was a pleasure to stay in her apartments which was just a couple of metres away from a perfect skyline view.,1
"Very nice place, comfortable and quiet with everything I needed. The location was perfect for getting to both downtown and the airport. Sara was an awesome host, very helpful.",1
Great ,1
"The experience was great: close to the subway, spacious, clean! The place was very well organized and the host was quick to respond",1
"Sara let me in and showed me around my little home for the next 3 days.  She was a gracious hostess.  Everything was spic and span and nicely decorated.  Bed very comfortable and amenities plentiful.  Loved the tiny ""kitchen"" in the closet. Neighborhood was great from the amazing view of Boston skyline from Pier's Park to the great coffee and breakfast sandwiches at Boston Brewin just a few blocks away at 154 Maverick.  And very quiet.  Maverick station a short walk and therefore easy to get to Boston or the airport.  I highly recommend it.",1
"Sara was a wonderful host. She was full of information about the area. The place was great! Lots of space and very close to the T subway station. Also, Sara has provided many perks such as a coffee, toiletries, DVD player with movies, etc. (Good Will Hunting was perfect for our Boston trip!). I highly recommend staying at her location if you are looking for a homey, private place to stay. 

Sara - Thank you again for the great hospitality! ",1
Very nice and clean place. We had a really good stay at Sara's apartment.,1
"Sara's place was great! She has everything you'll need. She even created a guest binder with lots of useful info. I recommend staying at her place to anyone. So close to the airport, too.",1
"Sara was an excellent host. She provided great instructions for how to check in and check out, making it a breeze. She was very welcoming with an informative binder providing tips for how to enjoy the city! The apartment is as it appears in the pictures, very neat and tidy. There were two of us and Sara had a separate bed set up and ready for us when we arrived. The neighbourhood also felt safe and was extremely convenient for hopping on the T to the downtown core, or to the airport stop on the Blue line to catch the free shuttle to our terminal.",1
Sara was extremely accommodating and made this a very positive first experience with airbnb. She graciously answered my many questions. The bed was very comfortable and the location was excellent for going to and from the airport as well as downtown.,1
Great access to the airport.  Our flight was delayed a day Sara's place was cozy and a good place to hunker down in a snow storm. It is a basement apt. but has nice personal touch.  Appreciate the coffee and oatmeal etc. We would stay again. Thank you Sarah!,1
"made to feel really welcome,and was given full information about the apartment and area. it was a shame that there was so much snow with more expected so couldn't appreciate the area. It was close to the MBTA so could get to downtown and back to the airport very easily. very comfortable apartment, with coffee machine microwave and fridge. great italian restaurant round the corner. thank you sara for a great visit thanks also for the comprehensive visitor folder",1
"Very comfortable apartment, exactly as described. The bed is super comfy, lots of warm blankets and a really nice mattress.
Sara was very easy to communicate with, very responsive by email & by phone. We were there for 2 days - checking in and out was very easy. Great neighborhood, very close to Maverick Sq",1
"Sara was super accommodating and helpful. Our flight was delayed and she made sure everything was OK and waited until we got there safe and sound. She gave us lots of useful tips on the neighborhood and tours around Boston.

The place was just a few minutes walk to the T. The rooms are clean and warm. Sara even prepared 2 electric heaters for us just in case the apartment heating wasn't enough.

Thanks Sara! I would definitely stay there again.
",1
"Sara's downstairs apartment was great for my 3 day visit. It's very clean and the bed was perfect. Quiet apt and quiet neighborhood. The walk to Maverick Sq for the T was indeed 5 min max. Visitors should note that the Maverick T stop is only one stop from Logan airport, so you can't get more convenient than that. Sara was available to help whenever I had a question and was responsive to all my messages. Overall, an A+ experience for me.",1
"We needed a place to stay in east Boston on very short notice. Sara responded to my request within 20 minutes and made the effort to arrange the check-inn that evening, thanks Sara! The apartment was nice and big and included everything we needed. It was very cold and the heating was not working properly, but Sara made sure we would not get cold. She put Spaceheaters in the room and extra sheets on the bed.
We enjoyed our stay!
",1
Room was as pictured and Sara is easy to deal with.,1
Sara was GREAT! We arrived a little earlier than expected but she was super accommodating! Her place is really cute and we were very thankful for the spare toothbrush she had out! We had totally forgotten ours at the last place! Thanks again!,1
"Sara was a great host. She is very clear when giving instructions which made the process very smooth. She definitely seems like an experienced host.

Her apartment is much larger than i expected and can very comfortably fit 4 people.  It's also right by the maverick train station making it very easy to get around boston.",1
"Highly recommend! Unfortunately we weren't able to meet Sara personally, but she was an excellent host! Her apartment was very nice, SUPER close to the Blue Line, and very well maintained! She was very communicative and helpful with us.",1
"Sara's place was cute, comfortable and super convenient. Just the right spot to stay close to everything in Boston for St. Patrick's Day. She wasn't there when we arrived, but made sure we could access the apartment via lock box. We had a great time!  ",1
Great stay! Sara was so nice and had everything ready for us. The bed and futon were both comfy enough. This locations proximity to the train station was perfect for us. No trouble parking in this neighborhood either. I would definitely come back. Thank you!,1
"The description in the advertisement was excellent. Sara's instructions, the very useful manual she prepared for us, the coziness of the apartment and the many many amenities made us feel home. The neighborhood is clean, safe and quite. The metro is just three minutes away. Downtown Boston is just 10-15 mins away. The airport is also very close by (15 to 30 mins in total). Great experience! I very much recommend this apartment!",1
"Sara was great...showed us around the apt as soon as we arrived. Everything looked like the pictures...very nice.  Comfortable, and with lots of nice little extras. My only complaints are minor. The wi-fi had some problems and cut off at times. Also, because we were there on a Thursday when they do street cleaning I had to get up very early to move my car and it took quite awhile to find a spot. This is not under Sara's control of course. Overall, a very nice experience!",0
"I had a pretty crazy (and ever-changing) schedule but Sara was flexible and made it easy to coordinate! The place was clean, quiet, and exactly as described. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to explore the neighborhood so can't speak much to that. ",1
"Sara was great. Very accommodating and responsive. The apartment is located quite close to the subway, making it easy to get around.",1
"This place was really great! My friends and I had a great night of sleep there, it's quiet and confortable! Sara is very nice and carefull",1
"Sara was a good communicator, making our visit easy and fun. Excellent directions to get there by foot, told us of late night pizza place 5 mins away, she even hauled my huge heavy bag up the stairs before I could stop her. Clean and comfy room.",1
"The apartment was very clean, all was like the description said, the apartment has a comple stuff... the only problem is that the internet connection some times is very slow and there was a leak in the bathroom.",0
"Pros: Sara is prompt, responsive, polite and helpful, especially for a short notice request. The location is great, close to the T and the airport, in a safe neighborhood.  The description is spot on, but the furniture is in a slightly different arrangement from the photos.  The guest information book and the takeout menus were a lifesaver, as my husband and I arrived (easily by Uber from the airport) past 1am and were starving! (The Chinese Dragon delivered exactly on time and was pretty tasty.)  The ""kitchen closet"" had flatware that the restaurant forgot to give us.  There's an extra sitting room with a futon and a basket with a ton of helpful tourist information.  We loved watching Netflix on the Roku while eating our late dinner.  Sara has a fun, eclectic variety of DVDs to choose from, too.  She provided us clean towels.  She leaves really easy, clear directions for everything, from checking in and out to switching the TV between Roku and DVD modes.  All these little details make you feel like you're in a friend's home.

Cons: When we finally settled in for bed around 3am, we pulled back the fluffy comforter to discover what looked like old sheets.  They looked like they'd been washed, but were severely pilled and discolored in some areas.  We ended up sleeping on top of the flat sheet, which looked clean and more crisp.  The room is chilly (which is probably great in the summer!).  We were provided an effective space heater but it was a bit loud, so it woke me a few times when it switched on throughout the night.

Thank you for hosting us on such short notice and providing such spot on information for our first airbnb experience!",0
Sara was great to communicate with. Her place is as pictured. It is close to the airport and was great for a stopover. The stairs down are not the ones pictured however they are tight with suitcases. ,1
"As long as you plan to use the public transport this location could not be better. Close to airport but no noise from it, just two stops from central Boston, was perfect for us as we were out all day. However, if you plan to spend a lot of time where you stay this may not be for you as it is a basement, no openable window, strong smell of cat ( we own and love cats but this was a little strong for us). That said Boston is very expensive and this room reasonably priced for Boston. Kitchen area is microwave and kettle. Washer and drier we did not use but look impressive. If room had been cleaner and without cat smell would of given a 4 star review.",0
"I had planned on short 2 day notice(with +2 guests) to reserve a spot in Sara's AirBnB. Her place was very clean and cozy. She did a professional job in having amenities such as laundry, TV,  toaster/microwave, and plenty of guides for Boston. 

I'd recommend coming back to stay here if you want an affordable yet comfortable stay in the city of Boston. ",1
"We didn't get a chance to meet Sara, but her directions and communications were great. We arrived and were able to access the room with no trouble at all.
The room and bathroom were just as described and allowed us a fantastic stay in Boston.  Very comfortable bed and the room was nicely decorated.
3 min walk to T and so convenient to city centre ( 2 stops to State) but also very convenient for airport (just one stop away by T) 
All in all a brilliant stay!",1
We enjoyed the proximity of the studio to the Boston Logan airport.  We had an extremely early flight and the taxi ride to the airport was only $10.  The studio worked well for what we needed.  We were only there for the night before our flight.  Sara left us with a very organized binder with everything from internet instructions to local eateries and taxi phone numbers.  She gave us a tour of the studio and was very helpful.,1
Great location! An easy walk to the T and one stop to the airport or in the other direction many attractions only 1 or a few stops away. Worked perfectly for my agenda. I couldn't have asked for a better spot. Sara made everything simple; from key pickup to my morning cup of coffee each day.  I only issue I had was with my Verizon cell service but since I didn't spend much time in the room and  the internet worked just fine this didn't cause me any worries. I will try to stay here again the next time I am in Boston.,1
"Sara was welcoming and helpful to us. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. We would stay here again and we recommend it to others.
",1
"The room was clean and spacious and well appointed with convenience items like soap etc, as well as coffee/tea. I found the bed to be very comfortable. Sara was excellent in communicating to arrange access, and the location is on a nice quite street. It provided exactly what I was hoping for - a nice/clean place to sleep while in town for business without having to spend $350 for a hotel room. ",1
"Sara was extremely informative. When we arrived she showed us the place and made sure we understood how all of the amenities worked. Overall, the place was tidy and homey. Thanks for everything Sara!",1
It was nice. Great location! Thanks Sarah!,1
The apartment was clean and in a great location.  Sara was a great host!  ,1
The apartment looked like in the pictures and was fully equipped. We only stayed one night but the bed was really comfortable we slept great! The communication was perfect and fast and Sara held our bags for late check out. Perfect for our short stay,1
Sara was great! We arrived later in the night due to the Red Sox game and she was able to let us in and show us around. Everything is exactly how it was advertised. Thank you again!,1
"The studio was in the basement and it was not bad.  Limited sunlight due to it being in the basement. There was a small, worn loveseat and a small tv.  Small makeshift kitchenette area with coffee. There are somewhat steep stairs down so keep that in mind.  It was sufficient for our needs for one night. ",0
Sara is such a great hostess! She provided so many pointers for what to do in the area and how to get around. Her apartment is very close to the subway and several little gems in her neighborhood. (Italian express pizzeria...go here you won't regret it). It's also just a short walk for a fabulous view of the downtown area and the harbor! Thank you so much for your hospitality Sara!! :),1
"Sara was very accommodating to our arrival/need to leave our bags early. The room was clean and well stocked with supplies, and the bed was comfortable. ",1
"I had a great stay at Sara's place. Sara was accommodating and good with communication. She also has really detailed directions in her house manual which saved me a bit of money as I ended up using the T instead of a taxi. I've stayed in a few airbnb properties before Sara's and she was the only one to have a folder full of useful information (transport,  tourist sites,  food, etc) and it was much appreciated. I used the tourist info to fill my spare day.

The bed is also really comfy and I slept really well. Having Netflix is also a bonus for night time.",1
"Sara was very nice and accommodating! The studio was clean and well kept, with all needed amenities.",1
"Although I did not even meet Sarah, everything worked out perfectly. Thanks for the nice and very convenient stay!",1
"Our host was a nice person, just beware its a basement and is prone to the issues a basement can have.",0
"I felt very welcome (Sara is a sweet host) and description of the room fit well with the place (do notice that it is a basement room). Neighborhood was nice and safe, though not a lot of restaurants or cafés. you may have a nice walk to the water side where one can watch Boston centre from a distance across the water - very nice :)",1
"I was looking for a place to stay in between a flight into Boston and a bus trip the following day. Sara's place is conveniently located, a short walk from the Maverick T station on the Blue Line. 
Check-in was uncomplicated; we connected via texting. The studio itself is a basement space with little natural light. It is otherwise as described - no frills, but it did the trick for my needs.
The bed was comfortable, the couch was aging, and something in the space triggered my allergies. No idea if it was cat hair, mold, or something completely different, but my eyes were watering and my nose stuffed up. I think around 5 am, the batteries of a smoke detector  in an adjacent room started failing, so I got a nice chirp for the rest of my night. It was also quite warm, but Sara provided a big box fan that cooled things down.
Overall, the experience was more or less what I expected and what I needed, since I was not looking for a luxury hotel.",0
"Sara was very quick to answer any of my emails or questions and although she couldn’t be there to meet us with the keys, she texted all the details in advance so we could easily get in and out. The place is located in a great neighbourhood, super close to the subway which took us right downtown. Unfortunately, although the air bnb was cute - I’m not sure if there was a flooding recently or what, but the air had a very strong smell of mold. There was an air purifier, but it didn’t feel like it did much and was just really loud throughout the night. We also couldn’t use the bedding because when we lifted the sheets, it was full of hair and chip crumbs…. so we slept on our sleeping bags on the bed….. Otherwise, Sara did stock the place with coffee, toiletries, towels and even tourist information about the city which was a very cute touch. ",0
"Our hostess, Sara made us feel welcome, and the location was nice, only one T stop to the Airport and one T stop to Long Wharf. The ""Welcome Book"" had very useful information. But we were disappointed in several factors of the space.
",0
"Location was very convenient: quiet street, close to a beautiful park with wonderful view of downtown Boston, and close to the subway station. The room was as advertised, quite large and with all amenities (+lots of tourist info). It's in the basement, so not a lot of light, and a bit damp+ feels like a basement= the drier was on when we arrived, plus there was a recycling bin full of empty bottles, and everything wasn't perfectly clean, but still alright all in all (and you can do laundry easily, so there's that). Free street parking on the WE. ",0
Great Studio near the airport. Great views of the city just 2-3 blocks down the road and lots of stuff to walk to. Sara has done a great job putting a binder full of helpful ideas to help you settle in. ,1
We had a pleasant time in Sara`s apartment! Anytime again.,1
Sara was a fantastic host. Very helpful and gave us a folder of places to eat/go. Lots of travel guides for Boston and other places in the USA in the apartment which was helpful. Description was accurate. Tv had netflix. Very close to the T and the airport. Unfortunately our only complaint was that the apartment smelled like urine. We couldn't find where the smell was coming from but it was strongest around the sofa which was a bit off putting. ,0
Sara was great and very welcoming. Had everything prepared and ready for check in and her overview and booklet provided answers to any and all questions I had.,1
"Host was easy to contact, very nice and provided clear instructions/directions. Loved the welcome packet and the Keurig coffee maker. Space was cute and exactly as pictured, except there were no warning pics of the extremely narrow and deep staircase down to the apartment. I wasn't sure I was going to get my 40lb, 25"" spinner down and back up without falling and breaking my neck. Upon entering there was a faint odor as if a litter box needed cleaning, but after being there a short time I didn't notice it anymore. The major problem was the heat (I was there in August). I knew there was no A/C but apparently there was no ventilation either. There was a de-humidifier and a large fan that was so loud I couldn't hear the TV, but it only blew the hot air around. The place was like a sauna; I didn't stop sweating the entire time I was there. I stayed one night, couldn't sleep because it was so hot, and got out of there as soon as I could the next morning.",0
"I needed an affordable place to crash for one night in Boston near the airport and Sara's basement apartment worked out well.  It's great if you don't need anything to fancy and wanna save some money, close to the T line, and very close to the airport.  ",1
Sara was very responsive in making arrangements for the stay. The apartment is very convenient to the airport (one blue line stop away or a $8 taxi ride). There is plenty of room and a fan kept the place cool on a very hot day.,1
"Sara was very easy to correspond with and made us feel very welcome. Her studio was in a perfect location, a lovely quiet area, easy to reach from the airport and a few minutes away from the waterfront where there are fantastic views of the Boston skyline. It is extremely quick and easy to reach downtown Boston on the subway. There are eating places a short walk away. We really liked the area, enjoyed our stay and would use Sara's studio again! Thank you Sara.",1
"Sara was a very welcoming host and provided a tour of the space upon our arrival. This place is great if you are on a budget, but not the most comfortable during the summer since there is no AC. Like others had mentioned, there noticeable smell upon entering the apartment, probably due to the lack of ventilation in the space. A fan was provided, but it was an old fan that was so loud, that it was impossible to watch netflix and have the fan on at the same time. Additionally, the  roku to play netflix was an old system, so you can't even watch with subtitles on.",0
"Sara is a good host. At first we entered a wrong address and lost our way, she texted the correct one. The WELCOME book is very helpful and there are lots of tourist info in the room. It's in basement and the signal is not good. Plus the fridge is not very clean. ",0
Sara was very responsive and answered any questions we had leading up to our stay. The apartment is in a nice area and close to the Maverick T station. The room was comfortable and we were provided with all necessary appliances. Would definitely recommend.,1
The place was nice and clean and everything worked out very well. Sara has made a nice folder with all the basic and practical information which is helpful. Quick and easy access to Boston with the T from Maverick and the best skyline views from Piers Park around the corner from the apartment.,1
"Sara has been very kind to accept us in late evening and show us all the apt commodities. The apt is comfortable and in a great position for the airport, also in a walk distance for Pier Park in which enjoy an awesome skyline of Boston.
Thanks Sara!",1
Host and family are very friendly and accommodating. Exactly as described. ,1
"The host is a nice lady. But the room is in the basement and the bed is a twin size, no private parking. Need to use fans so the room is hot (no air conditioner) and noisy. We can hardly sleep during the night. The bed material is bad make it even warmer.",0
"I didn't have the chance to see Sarah, I was communicating with her via email and sms and she was responding very quick to my questions, her mother was very welcoming despite the fact that I arrived 3 hrs late and after midnight!! Great place, includes every thing you need for either a long or short stay, I would definitely recommend this place.  ",1
"It was really cozy! and also her mother Susan was very nice!!
If there was air conditioner it would be better :)
But it was good !!!",1
"Sara was not there, but his mother help us very well she explained us very well all the house rules and we really liked that ",1
The apartment is something like a basement. Very hot and with a unique little window. Good position near main street. ,0
Our stay at Sara's place was very enjoyable. We felt great staying there. The appartment is located close to downtown Boston (couple subway stops) and very close to the airport. Thanks to Sara and her Mom.,1
"This host is very organized and accommodating. She walked us through her book of things to do and went out of her way to meet us at the door even when our flight was delayed late into the night.  The room is in the basement and unfortunately, does smell a bit of cat pee. Once the window is open, it helps air flow. ",0
"I recommend Sara's place. Very close to the T-line which can bring you basically everywhere in Boston. The place and the neighborhood are ok, we felt safe at all times. 
Sara responded very quickly to our queries and she even helped us get to the airport.
All in all, it was a pleasant experience.",1
"Had a great time at Sara's for our overnighter in Boston.  Although the place has some steep stairs in and out, the apartment is quite cozy and fully stocked.  The location is great, with markets, restaurants, and the train station just minutes away.  The neighborhood is safe and makes for a great walk, with the waterfront and spectacular views of downtown just around the corner.  Sara herself is amazing.  She was full of suggestions on what to do around Boston, including lots of free stuff only the locals know about!  We will definitely consider her place again the next time we are in Boston!",1
"Although never met Sara in person since we were in town only briefly overnight and our schedules did not jive,  Sara made it very easy to get in and out.  She promptly made excellent suggestions for dinner as requested.  She answered all our questions and requests thoroughly and has the most complete and helpful house manual we have ever seen in our Airbnb experience worldwide.  Her place is incredibly convenient between airport and downtown just minutes away from the ""T"", Boston's subway, which we utilized with her helpful instructions and saved us lots of time and money.",1
"Sara's apartment is a very cozy place when we come back after go sightseeing outside all day. There are all facilities including microwave oven, coffee machine, fridge which make our stay comfortable. ",1
"Sara's home is near the metro station, about 5-8 minutes walk. And it is safe at night.There's only a few stations you can reach downtown. Meanwhile it is near the Logan airport, this is very convenient  for us. Sara is a very kind girl, she helped me to carry my luggage downstairs into the room, and gave us a detail introduction and information. It seems she has a very cute dog :)",1
"The studio apartment was perfect for our overnight stop over in Boston.  We were coming off of an international flight, and had a very early connection the next morning, and this apartment is minutes from the airport.  It saved us the worry of having to rent a car for nine hours, and from having to try and figure how to maneuver around a strange city.  
Sara was very quick at returning all communication about checking in, and when we arrived at the apartment she greeted us and showed us around.  I was super impressed with what she had put together...she has everything you could need to enjoy your stay all in one binder, organized with house rules, local attractions, maps, and menus to restaurants in the area.  
The studio is exactly what you see in the photos.  It is a basement apartment in an old historic building, super cute, and very different from the single story ranch houses that we have in Texas.  The stairs were steep, so watch your step when you enter, but the bed was comfortable, the shower was hot, and there was coffee.  I would stay here if we were spending more time in Boston!
All in all we had a very positive experience in the studio.  ",1
The location was convenient to the airport and North End for our quick overnight stay in Boston.  Sara was accommodating an also had excellent communication.  The room was comfortable. We utilized the bed and also the pull out sofa.  We let Sara know of the sleeping arrangements and she had the sofa made into a bed upon arrival.  If her schedule allows she will take you to the airport for a small fee.  An excellent value in a fabulous city.  ,1
"Pros:
1. Well located - a few stops from downtown and attractions in Boston
2. Sara is well prepared and the room has everything you need

Cons:
1. Room smells of moisture very badly and we had to buy air freshner to be able to stay there
2. There were flies in the room, i killed 3
3. The room was tidy but thrre was dust on the furniture
4. The shower had very low water pressure",0
"Close proximity to the airport, this place was cozy. Sara was great in getting back to me quickly. ",1
"The listing description, photos are all accurate. The studio was clean and cozy. Sara is wonderful as a host. She gave me details on how to reach the keys. A green book that has everything you need to know to get your TV, wifi, keys, groceries, getting to know Boston and etc to work (I can tell she put a lot of hard work in this!). My family had a long flight coming to Boston and they had a great stay for sure. It was wonderful how this place was close to the airport and she could even take my family to the airport the next morning due to their early flight for a great price. The neighborhood is quiet and this place is a 5-8 min walk from the Maverick station. ",1
"This apartment worked out perfectly for our short stay in Boston. Really close to the airport and the T station, which made it easy to get everywhere that we wanted to. Sara was very easy to get a hold of, and check-in/check-out was a breeze. She even gave us a ride to the airport at 4:30 in the morning! Would recommend this place highly to anyone.",1
"Sara’s apartment was in a great location, close to both the airport and the city by metro. In fact, if you’re game, you don’t even need to catch the metro to the airport, you can just walk 15 mins to where the metro-airport shuttle bus stop is. We didn’t meet Sara, but by phone she was really friendly and responsive. She also had a book in the apartment with great suggestions for free/cheap things to do in Boston, and places to go for $1 oysters! There is a small TV with Netflix, which was good to have after a long day out in Boston.

The studio itself was nice, the pictures represent it well. My only criticism is that because it is a basement, there is a bit of a musty smell – but you get used to the smell pretty quickly, and it clears out once you let some air in, so this didn’t diminish our enjoyment of the apartment.

Overall we had a great stay in Boston and I would definitely recommend staying here.
",1
"Despite the good location and the attractions and facilities offered by Sara our arrival, my assessment is negative given that there is a strong urine smell of cat, in the room, impossible to remove and which makes the stay very unpleasant (reading other reviews it seems coming from far away not to take solutions)Definitely it would not repeat the stay",0
"Even though the location was convenient we would not stay here again. Sara was good at communicating but she was not prepared for us.  We had issues with the following: the odor was unbearable, the shower had very little pressure, tv channels did not work, the stairs need cleaning and the linens had hair on them even though they were clean. ",0
"My parents and I stayed at Sara's listing for 3 nights during our visit to Boston. It was nice to be away from the bustle of downtown Boston, but also be super convenient to the T and only two short stops away from attractions like Faneuil Hall, Boston Common, etc. & one stop from the airport. Sara's place is super cute and in a good area - we got back to the room late a couple of nights and never felt unsafe on the walk back from the T station. The stairs are a little steep as the room is in the basement, but as long as you pay attention that shouldn't be an issue. Also, the weather was perfect when we were there so AC wasn't necessary, but I could see the room getting warm in the summer months. Overall, we were very comfortable & would stay here again. (Never got a chance to meet Sara as I don't think our schedules jived on this trip, but she was very accommodating, allowing us to check in early since our flight landed before 2.) ",1
"Sara greeted me upon arrival and showed me around the studio apartment which is as pictured. Note that there are steep steps since it is a basement apartment.   She provides a Keurig, Coffee, mini fridge   and microwave also a book with restaurants and points of interest in the area.   This listing was perfect for my needs  as I was traveling alone for business and only needed a stay for 1 night.  I was leaving from Logan and this listing is very close to the airport. The shower and room were clean and I felt safe in the neighborhood walking to get dinner and would recommend this listing for a short stay.  Parking was a challenge however I was able to get a spot around the corner from the listing. The train and restaurants are within walking distance.

"Pros:
-Close to airport and downtown, short walk to Maverick Square and Blue Line.
-Check-in was fine, no delays or issues.
-Laundry available (if you'll be staying for awhile).
-DVD player with 19"" flat screen. She has several DVDs in the dresser below.
-K-cup machine, kettle, tea.
-Fair number of toiletries available if you need them.
-Water for shower/washing was hot.
-Wireless internet was reliable.

Cons:
-Basement apartment, not much light or air circulation.
-To be honest, the apartment wasn't clean. At all. It was clear to me that she basically changes the sheets on the bed and that's about it.
-Netflix worked intermittently. Because it frequently stalled, it wasn't really usable. Watching DVDs was fine, however.
-Water pressure in shower was pretty weak. It's going to take you a little longer to wash all the suds off your body.
-Bath towels were damp upon arrival.
-Fold-out bed in loveseat was not clean, so we decided not to use it.

The greatest advantage of staying here is the location. However, the space did not feel welcoming and frankly was a little disgusting. This apartment is really best for those who need or desire to be close to both downtown and the airport and do not plan on spending much time at the apartment, using it only as a place to sleep. If you enjoy relaxing at the end of your day in your room/apartment or want to do any of your own cooking, I'd avoid this listing. Sara was thorough in her orientation and made check-in easy, but we did not see her for the rest of our stay. She also avoided making eye contact with us during check-in (perhaps just a nervous habit). This did not bother us in any way, but if you are the kind of guest who enjoys/desires interaction with your host, this probably isn't the place for you. ",0
"We only stayed for one night but the flat was well organised, Sara gave us a good introduction and we found everything we needed including coffee for the morning. The bed was comfortable and the location was great.",1
"Sara's apartment was in a great location (quick travel to the airport and to downtown Boston). The space looks exactly like the pictures. We had a bit of a fly problem and I wish the Internet connection was a bit better, but other than that it served its purpose. ",0
The apartment was just like at photos. It was well equipped and Sara did everything to help me feel me welcome.,1
"First 2 days had a crazy amount of bugs, but she was very nice about it and helped out. Initial room had an interesting smell, but you dont notice after a while. Checking in should be very easy!",0
Sara was very accommodating and met me at the door. The room was exactly as expected and quite comfortable. It was also very close to mass transit which made things very easy. I would recommend Sara to anyone.,1
Great place to stay in ! It offers a great location as well as a very clean and tidy studio. RECOMMENDED !,1
Had a great stay and everything was just as described. Sara was really helpful in answering all our questions. The best thing about the apartment is its close proximity to the subway that made getting around the city really easy.,1
Sara was a great host and the apartment was amazing and in a good location. Would definitely stay here again!!,1
"Overall, its a pretty nice apartment with almost everything you need.If only the bathroom is better equipped...",0
"Sara was helpful and accommodating. The room is cozy. 
It is also in the basement, with a tiny window that  onto the sidewalk. 
Don't open the window, no fresh air. 

When I arrived, the thermostat read 76 degrees.I turned it down, and went out for dinner. Several hours later, the room was still 76 degrees. I called Sara to help me with the temperature, as the thermostat was not working. Bottom line: shut the heat off, on a Boston winter night.

Next morning, the shower was miserable. A sorry little stream of water, no pressure whatsoever. Temperature was hot, but it was a very unsatisfactory way to start the day.

This room could be a great situation but for those issues. 
I would not go back, unless they were addressed.",0
"Great layout and exactly what I was looking for. Sara was communicated very well and the apartment while small, has everything a passing through traveler would need. I was worried about transportation, but many Uber cars are around even at 5:00am. ",1
Had a great time at Sara's - it's such a convenient location to the airport! Thanks so much!!,1
"I stayed at Sara's place for one night on a business trip. The location was great, I was looking for something convenient from South Station. I had a rental and there was plenty of overnight street parking. Her basement studio is super cute, bathroom is fully stocked, and there is even a little fridge/microwave/coffee pot area similar to what you get in a hotel. 

Key pick up was easy, communication was great. She is very thorough, there was even an extensive guide book that she put together with all the info you could ever need. 

Be prepared to carry your luggage down a flight of narrow, steep stairs. My bag was not big, so it was no big deal for me, but if you had huge suitcases it would be a bit of a struggle. ",1
Sara's place was amazing!!! It's a very peaceful and serene setting. Very quiet street.. Cozy house.... And and very comfortable bed!!! ,1
"Sara is a great and friendly host. I stayed at her place with my boyfriend for three nights, and she was wiiling to help and answer every quesion. Her place is very close to the T station, the airport and downtown location. The green booklet in the room with all the information is excellently helpful. The room itself is cozy. Strongly recommend!:)",1
Sara and the apartment were both incredible; checking in and out couldn't have been easier and the apartment was very cozy.   Would absolutely stay here again when back in Boston.,1
"Sara was always readily available and answered all questions promptly. The place was just as it appears on the site, clean and organized. It is an easy 5-6 minute walk to the train station and has very easy access to downtown. The only downside was there seemed to be an open vent somewhere so it was a tad cold and there seemed to be a fly or two that snuck in somehow. Other than that, it was a great stay. The coffee was a HUGE help!!!",1
Sara was very kind and welcoming and moving in was uncomplicated. The room is nice and the location is conveniently located close to the airport.,1
Sara was very nice and welcoming. She was very caring to show me everything I needed to know for the studio. ,1
"Sara was a very friendly host. She checked us in with great detail in spite of her busy schedule. Her check-in folder was by far the most comprehensive AirBnB folder I've seen and we didn't have questions that weren't already answered. She was very responsive and helped us feel at home!

Thank you Sara... You are awesome! ",1
"The room is great with everything you need! And very convenient to public transportation and airport. Also, the instruction book was very impressive with all the detail. Great experience, thanks! ",1
Nice host. Apartment is in a very convenient location. Water pressure is very low making showers difficult.,0
Sara's mother welcomed us that day since Sara is out of town. She is very considerate and make sure everything ok for us. The room is clean and comfortable. ,1
"Sara's apartment was nothing short of nice - we did not get to meet Sara, but Susan (her mom) was a great host. She made every effort to make us feel welcome, and we got to even meet her pet Yorkie and Garfield!

The room is true to its' depiction- of course, the steep flight of stairs down was initially a little daunting for us, since we had a quite a bit of luggage to carry, but once we got it in, it was just perfect.

I'd like to thank Susan for being a wonderful host - sharing with us stories about her kids (she's proud mom of three :) ), and life in Michigan, in the peaceful rural hinterlands.

And thank you for the lift to the airport - we can't begin to express how grateful we were for that - you left a wonderful start to our journey in America :)",1
"I did not meet Sara but her mom who welcomed me. I had a great stay, everything was just as described. The location is also great, very close to the train station- one stop away from the airport and two to three stations away from the city center- depending on where you exactly want to go. The instruction book with a listing of all the sightseeing and the relevant train station I also found very helpful!
All in all, everything was very well-organized and I can really recommend anybody to stay in Sara's studio!",1
"We needed a simple studio close to the airport and Sara's place was perfect. It is cozy and cute, the bed is very comfortable. It is not far from the Center and very convenient. Sara's mom welcomed us and was very nice. I would definitely recommend this studio. ",1
The place is very close to the airport and also very easy to go to the (URL HIDDEN)'s mom Susan is very nice and considerate for s.Thanks a lot!,1
The apartment was exactly how described and perfect for our stay. It was in a great location very close to the T stop. We were able to leave our bags early since we got in earlier than our check in time without any problem. I would definitely recommend. ,1
"My wife and sister were traveling with me back to the United States from Portugal going through Boston. The host was incredibly well prepared; there was a comprehensive binder highlighting transportation, dining and anything else we might need.  The host was great company and treated us with respect. We would happily book again next time we're in Boston.",1
"Sara is a friendly and organized person, and her studio is also very nice and clean. I have a great night staying there. 
highly recommend it!!",1
"Sara's apartment is wonderful - easy to find, very accessible to downtown and quite close to the airport too. As a hostess you couldn't ask for better - great information about the local area and very accommodating in terms of arrival and departure. 
The room/apartment has everything and is in a nice quiet neighbourhood. I really hope I have a chance to go back again sometime and spend even longer there. ",1
"My girlfriend and I LOVED staying at Sara's apartment for our first visit to Boston. Location was more than ideal (and picturesque) as it was only a few minutes away from both airport and downtown Boston by subway. She was incredibly helpful and accommodating before and during our trip. We will definitely be looking at staying here again on our next excursion to Boston! THANK YOU, SARA!",1
"Sara was very accommodating. We arrived late and it was no issue and she was very thorough in helping us get in.  The place was exactly what we needed. Nothing fancy just a place to sleep after a long day of traveling. 

The bed was very comfortable and the place was warm. We didn't use the shower/bathroom, tv, or any amenities so I cannot review. Overall a great place and host. I would stay again, its a perfect location next to the airport and T. ",1
"Thanks for a great stay Sara!  My sister and I had a perfectly good stay here for our night out in Boston.  Apartment was a little further from the TD Garden than I originally thought (a $10-15 Uber ride) but it was fine for our one night! 

",1
"I stayed at Sara's place for a residency interview at MGH. Getting to and from both the airport and the hospital was quick and simple, and Sara provided easy-to-follow directions. The apartment is small but clean and perfectly matches her description. Sara was a very attentive host and provided plenty of info regarding local places to eat, landmarks, etc.",1
"Staying at Sara's was a great experience, my friends and I needed an affordable place to stay for the night and this was perfect. It felt very comfortable and we felt right at home. Would absolutely recommend to anyone!",1
The space was great and very easy to get in and out of! Sara was easy to communicate with as well. Thanks for the binder of info--so helpful!,1
"Sara was very flexible, accommodating with our check-in time, and communicative. Exactly as described. Was grateful for the coffee machine :) Located in East Boston, it was a 10 minute drive to the touristy locations (Freedom Trail, etc.) I was able to find street parking before 5pm and we could park for free overnight. ",1
"The appartment is really cozy and warm. It's really well isolated from souand and light. It's easy to walk from the airport to the appartement.  Just be careful, the park when you get out the shuttle is close so you need to walk by the street. 

I saw some weird people in the streets getting there, but it was midnight. When we leave the appartment in the morning, they was really more nice looking people in the streets ! ",1
"Sara was a great host - could not have been more flexible. We were only in Boston for 36 hours and Sara's apartment was ideal - close to the airport, close to a T system station and local shops.

The apartment was very cosy with a comfortable bed. We appreciated the good internet connection and the Netflix TV service. Having a coffee maker and supplies of coffee was great.

We would love to stay again during a future visit to Boston !",1
Sara was very friendly. The space is cute and was good for the one night we needed it. ,1
"The cab drivers didnt know how to get there, but it was very close to the airport ans convienent. Sara was very nice and everything in the description was accurate.",1
Extremely welcoming and friendly! Sara is a wonderful host and has an excellent knowledge of the city.,1
"Sara was great and very helpful, the place was very cozy, just a quick walk from the subway station in a great location.

It was our first experience with AirBnB and we really enjoyed it, she went as far as providing coffee, disposable utensils, a small but very nice DVD collection, lots of brochures about local atractions and take out fliers.

If (when) going back to Boston we're definitely looking to stay there again.",1
"Had a nice stay! Was only in town for 1.5 days so this was perfect. The apt is accurately depicted in the post, which is important to me. ",1
"Everything was great - Host was able to get us checked in late and the bed was very comfortable - Had a washer/dryer, fridge, coffee maker and great internet. All that was so nice and it's close to a Metro Line - Best deal in town!!!",1
"We had a nice, convenient stay at Sara's apartment. She was easy to communicate with, and was accommodating with our arrival time. Location is great, within two blocks of the T and a nice view of the river and the city!",1
"We were warmly greeted by Sara and then shown around the hosts guest area. Sara explained everything and also directed us to the folder she had prepared for guests ( this lists in a clear way everything you need to know). The place was ideal for us , positioned on the east side of the City with easy access to Logan Airport and the MBTA. We had a comfortable stay.",1
"This is a great apartment. It was clean and spacious, and Sara was very welcoming and helpful. We also appreciated the coffee machine and small fridge.

We didn't get to check out much of the neighbourhood but it seemed quiet. We walked from Logan airport - probably about a 30 minute walk and would have been difficult without GPS, but doable if you want to save a little on a cab.",1
Easy to get into the location great place for the price. It was super easy to get into and out of. We were going straight from the airport and back the next morning and it made the commute very easy. If you are allergic to cats this is not the best apartment for you since my friend who has mild allergies needed to take medicine.,0
"Sara was a great host and very easy to communicate with. The apartment was the perfect size, value and location for our overnight stay in Boston. I would definitely recommend staying here.",1
"We had a lovely time in Boston, thanks in part to Sara and her very accommodating place. The bed was comfortable, and there were numerous accommodations to make the day-to-day easier, including coffee! Sara's instructions for getting into the place were great, making it easy to come and go as we pleased. ",1
Cozy little place to stay. We used an Uber to get back and forth to downtown. Quick and convenient. Check-in and out instructions were simple. ,1
"We didn't get to meet Sara in person, and had unique circumstances, in that we arrived late in the evening, and had to leave again at 330 am for a flight, but her place functioned perfectly as a 'crash pad' for the night, allowing us to get a little rest, and shower, before a further 20 hrs of flight. Be advised that the stairs down are extremely steep - fine for normal use, but may be difficult if you're wrangling substantial luggage, children, or if you have limited mobility. I appreciated that Sara was prompt in responding to a text regarding a question I had while we were there, and there's a really cute little Italian place in easy walking distance which was featured in DDD. We enjoyed our stay, and if ever we found ourselves needing to stay in that part of Boston again, wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. ",1
Fabulous place to stay in Boston! Love the location! ,1
"Sara was super helpful and suuuuper sweet! She was very accommodating with having to drop off luggage early and such! Her place was very cozy and comfortable as well! Thanks so much, Sara! ",1
Our second stay. This time for just a quick eight hour sleep! Sara's place is just a 10 min taxi ride to the airport! Perfect stopover!,1
"Sara made us feel welcome be allowing us to put our bags in the room even though it was not cleaned from the previous guests, it was very helpful.  Also she has a book that she made of things to do in Boston, from free to spendy, that was helpful.  The neighborhood was run down, but very convenient to the subway and two blocks from a beautiful park on the ccean, that had a great view of the Boston skyline. Also a little corner market about a block a way for fruit, etc.",1
"Sara was a great host, very flexible with arrival and departure and the apartment was nice and exactly as described.  ",1
"We had only one day and a half of night in Sara's place before our departure from Logan airport. The apartment has all you may need. Coffee machine with coffee for guests, detailed information about Boston, comfortable beds. The stairs down is rather steep, in case if you have large baggage. Nevertheless, it is good place for its location and price.",1
Perfect location for arriving at the airport and exploring the city during the day. All needed amenities were there and the stay was comfortable. Would stay again!,1
"Sara was great. We had a red eye and landed in Boston at 6:30am, and she was able to take our bags at 8am so we could explore the city. We also had a late flight on our departure, so she held our bags until we were ready to leave. She was gracious and we enjoyed staying with her. ",1
Great location to both the airport and downtown via the T. Perfect for our short stay in Boston for a music fest downtown. ,1
"Communication and access was very easy and efficient.
The apartment was just what we needed and Sara was very helpful even suggesting places to park overnight.
Thanks.",1
"This location was perfect for us, very close to the airport when we arrived late and then very near to the Maverick station when we moved on in the morning. 
Sarah was most helpful and met us when we arrived and the room was pleasant enough for our short stay.",1
"PLEASE DO YOUR RESEARCH BEFORE BOOKING ANY AIR BNB ACCOMMODATION! DON'T go off the star rating and just read the first couple of pages of the reviews. Sarah's place was one of the first airBnB accommodations we had booked for our USA travel trip . Sarah was very lovely but unfortunately her place was not and it definitely wasn't up to airBNB standards based on the other accommodation we have now stayed at (some places were cheaper and at a 5 star level) There is a constant smell that I can only describe as cat urine or a dirty cat litter tray... and one window with a note asking you not to open it.. Thinking I dropped something, I glanced under the bed to discover a pile of dust which explained our allergies playing up...there was also an incredible amount of dust on the fan provided. It is very close to public transport which will get you everywhere you need to go easily and is only a short trip from the airport. Sarah has a file of great places to visit in Boston, has a washer and dryer which was also very convenient. If the above wouldn't bother you then I say book this accommodation...otherwise please look else where because the price she charges is not worth it. I hope Sara reads this and rectifies the issues I've posted because it ruined an otherwise perfect air BnB. ",0
"Unfortunately we didn't meet Sara but the communication was excellent. The apartment is located in the basement. The bed is very comfortable, there is everthing provided (towels, tv, a fan, shampoo, shower gel, coffee machine, microwave, kettle, toaster, etc - everthing you need :-) ). 
There are many restaurants, grocery stores and bars in the neighborhood and you are only one stop from the airport with the T  and two stops from downtown. 
Actually we would rate 5 stars or even more because the apartment is really lovely and Sara was a great host. But there was a strong smell of cat pee or something like this... and this ruind the great experience a bit. 
",1
Great little studio close to the airport and just a couple blocks from the subway.  Sara was very welcoming and had an organized book of places to eat and things to see.  I definitely recommend a stay here!,1
"Sara's apartment is great.  Excellent location,  close to the Airport and Downtown.  Just what I needed.  The place was clean, bed was comfortable and it all looked just like the pictures.  Sara was very kind,  and answered all of my questions. I had a great stay!  Can definitely recommend her!",1
Great location for our short stay in Boston. ,1
Great stay.,1
Everything was as advertised.  Very easy to work with.  My only issue was the lack of available street parking.  I did receive a ticket despite moving my car before the 8:00am time stated.,0
"Once we arrived to the studio, Sara immediately greeted us and kindly assisted us with our baggage. I love how organised she is! She has a binder of FAQs  which was really useful. My favourite part of the studio is the fact that the subway station is literally a 3 mins walk away. The area is also safe which made us feel comfortable. 

Thank-you Sara for the hospitality. ",1
"Sara is a great host, very friendly. Walked me through the apartment upon arrival and made sure I had everything I needed. She was very organized-everything I needed to know (WiFi, nearby restaurants, how to work Netflix/Roku, etc) was contained in a binder she had on the table. I only stayed for one night, so didn't get a chance to use it, but her listing of fun things to do around the city was a nice touch.",1
Excellent location with plenty of private space.  Sara is super organized and had a folder of helpful information about her place and the surrounding area.  Would definitely stay here again. ,1
"Sara was really helpful re my arrival & also letting me leave my luggage til early afternoon as it meant I could do more tourist visits on my last morning. Access to the Subway was great - close, & quick into the City. The main entrance is not very nice, and once inside the building, the studio is down some narrow steep stairs which could be difficult for big cases or anyone a bit unsteady on their feet. As it's a basement it's dark. It was a hot spell during my visit & the air conditioner was helpful",0
"Sara's place was great for a 2 night stay. It's in East Boston so it's near the airport and only a few minutes from a T station. Everything was exactly as advertised. We really appreciated how thoughtful Sara is - from the helpful binder of FAQs to the signage she posts throughout the apartment - she put a lot of thought and time into making your stay as easy and comfortable as possible. She's also very quick to respond to inquiries and is very accommodating. The only negative that prevents me from giving 5 stars overall was the smell of cat pee that I suspect was coming from the couch. It's possible that a cat peed on the couch some time ago but the smell often returns in the hot and humid summer months in my experience. This may be particularly off-putting to some guests. Otherwise, Sara's apartment is everything you'd want for a great AirBnB experience. ",0
"The apartment is very close to an mbta station, which makes it easy to reach downtown Boston quickly. The apartment itself is clean and equipped with everything you might need. It is below ground and has only a very small window that cannot be opened. As other visitors already commented, there is an unpleasant odor that was present during our entire stay. In case you're looking for the ""airbnb experience"" in the sense of interaction with the host, you might be disappointed: we met Sara only for check-in and check-out.",0
"Sara was very helpful with information.  We did find the apartment very warm, although there is an air con unit.  It is a basement apartment and weather very hot on our stay.  very comfortable bed and fluffy white towels.",1
Sara was a great host. She was great with communication and was easy to work with. The place was in a convenient location. Everything was as pictured. The house did have a strong litter box smell. ,1
"Unfortunately, I was far from being satisfied with my stay at Sara’s place, below is a detailed explanation why I feel that way. 
I arrived at Boston for a one-night stay after a transatlantic flight on my way to another destination. Although I came early in the morning (9:00am) Sara allowed me to check-in and made things easy. Sadly, in a later correspondence with her I found out that  “gesture” won't be possible anymore because (quoting from our email correspondence): ""In the future I am going to make my 2pm check-in time firm, and won't allow early bag drop-off, as it has become too much of an inconvenience to cater to the needs of every traveler's individual schedule"".
 All through the night I heard loud noises from the ceiling above me (be aware that the unit is simply her basement floor), of what seemed to be animals running back and forth. The fact that the noises might have been rates, made my sleeping uncomfortable. Retrospectively, I understood that a dog and a cat were the cause for the noises during the night – a fact that was not mentioned in her original airbnb posting.  For those of who consider rent this place – take into consideration the fact that this apartment is a basement above which two very active pets live. If you are allergic to animals, or if you simply don’t want to hear animals running on the floor above you, simply know that it’s a risk you’re gonna take if you’ll stay there.  
The description of the apartment is misleading: ""enjoy beautiful skyline views from across the harbor"". That is simply far from being true. That view is probably possible from the roof of the building, not from the windowless basement! 
Lastly, alas the least disappointing of all, is the fact that the pathway with the stairs leading to the basement were very narrow which made it very difficult to transfer my luggage through. 
Given the above, it is obvious that if I would have known it’ll be such a disaster, I would have paid more and stated somewhere else. 
After my visit, I email Sara expressing my concerns about the noises; her reply was rude and inconsiderate. To my surprise, instead of showing solidary and understanding, her response culminated in “most city apartments have pets” and “maybe next time you should just go to an hotel”. This is not what I would expect from ANY host. 
All in all, if you still reading that feedback, here is what you need to take from it -if you’re interested in a windowless basement unit with a super narrow staircase, with pets running above your head, and with a host that does not care about your feedback – this is your place!!
",0
"Sara's place was nice for a one day stopover in Boston. It is a small basement apartment, but served our needs for a night. It is well furnished and stocked to make you feel at home. We didn't meet Sarah, but she was very quick to respond to our questions and coordinating our check in. The location between the airport and the city is convenient, and public transit is just a few blocks away for easy access. We loved the neighborhood. It is quiet but lively, and a pleasant escape from the city.",1
"I wouldn't recommend this place in its current state. My family and I had to leave and check into a nearby hotel at 9:30 PM because we couldn't stay here. The main bed broke when my mum sat on it, and the smell of cat urine was overwhelming. 

If the bed wasn't on its side and the place didn't smell like a cat's litter tray, this place would actually be perfect for the airport. The location is great, Sara was very helpful on arrival, the bathroom was perfectly adequate and the tea/coffee making facilities were great. Unfortunately, there was nowhere to sleep and the smell made a few of us quite ill. It's also a lot more claustrophobic than I was expecting.

We got a huge room at nearby hotel for a similar price to Sara's listing. This included breakfast, free shuttle service and a secure place to leave your bags after a generous checkout time – much better value for money. I normally love Airbnb, but this time it let me down. I regret not looking at the reviews more carefully as someone has raised the issue of the cat urine smell before. ",0
EXCELLENT location! Short walk to park overlooking Boston. Beautiful spot to watch sun set over the city. Neighbor hood felt safe and we walked to local restaurants. Very short uber ride into the city.  Sarah was very nice. Gave some good tips.  Let us know she was available for any arising issues. The place did have a pee smell though.,1
Great place to stay for a nice easy commute into the city! ,1
"We only stayed one night at Sara's Studio, but were more than satisfied.

The place was absolutely clean and tidy, Sara was there to welcome us and the check-in worked perfectly. Furthermore, Sara provides a little book with instructions on how to use the interior, and also tips for what to do in Boston as well as a set of gorcery stores and restaurants in the area. We find that every host on airbnb should provide one like Sara does, and were very positively suprised.

The Apartment is short walking distance to a blue Line station which makes getting into town and back to the studio very easy. The neighbourhood was safe, supermarkets and restaurants were also in 
walking distance. 

Overall, we would stay at Sara's studio again and would recommend to anyone on vacation in Boston.",1
"Perfect location, only 5 minutes from the airport. Quiet neighborhood but not far from downtown. I would stay again at Sara's place!",1
Waited up for my arrival -  since my plane was delayed and I didn't get in until the wee hours of the morning. Great crash pad near the airport.  I was able to walk to the to airport car rental facility the following day - saving me a night's rental. ,1
"Sara's place is one stop away from the airport, while being very close to the sites of Boston as well. Location wise it's excellent. Sara was there to greet me and was very friendly and provided a full run down on the apartment which answered any questions I might have come up with. Very comprehensive from attractions to restaurants that deliver. It is a small space. You could do three people but it would be a tight fit. It's better suited for 1-2. There's not a lot of natural light since it's basement level. If you need that be aware. The neighborhood is mostly residential so it's nice and quiet. I wouldn't bother with a car. Parking is tight, and outside of East Boston, navigating the rest of the city is an adventure at best.",1
"Sara lives in a great location! The biggest drawback was the staircase, which we were warned about. It definitely was a challenge getting the bags up and down the steep flight. As others have mentioned, there is a litter box smell, though no litter box is in sight. It was nice to have the washer and dryer available, even though we didn't use it. Plenty of room for two people, though. And everything was well stocked -- bathroom amenities and extra blankets were available. Plus Sara had a binder put together with lots of helpful city info. Easy trip to the airport, too. ",1
"Room was as listed, nice location in terms of being able close to the airport and city centre.  I didn't get to meet Sara due to clashes with her work schedule, but she was helpful with queries via email. ",1
Everything was as advertised on AirBnB. Sara´s place was just perfect for us as we had just one night in Boston. Everything was  nice and clean and communication with Sara worked perfectly. Perfect location if you want to be close to the airport. We would stay again with Sara!,1
"Perfect spot for us to spend the night before flying out of Logan.  It's close to all Boston has to offer and spacious enough for my husband, so and me as well as my parents and the in-laws.  Dan was a great host; answered all  our questions and made our stay more than we'd hoped for.",1
"We were in town and got lucky booking this place last minute, but so glad we did! I was worried about not having a car but the convenient location made things a breeze! 
Besides easy access to the seaport, our beds were comfy, the place was spotless, and Dan responded quickly to my inquiries. Thanks and would def stay again!",1
"We thoroughly enjoyed staying in Dan's apartment. It's in a very convenient part of South Boston, within a short walking distance to public transportation, a grocery store, good restaurants and pubs, as well as a few cute, local shops. The furnishings are comfortable; after long days of both work and sightseeing, we enjoyed relaxing in the living room to something on Netflix before falling asleep in the very comfortable new beds. 

The apartment is newly renovated, and we ran into an issue with a leak in the kitchen sink. However, Dan and his property manager were very easy to get a hold of and worked to fix the problem. It really did not affect our stay at all.

Dan was also great recommending places to eat, shop, and visit. I was in town for work, and my mom and sister came to experience Boston for the first time. Not only did they feel safe on their own in the neighborhood, they loved all of Dan's recommendations. 

I don't know when we'll be back in the area, but we'd definitely want to stay here again. ",1
"The apartment was really nice, everything was as described and the communication with Dan was easy and quick. I would take it again!",1
Thank you for making us feel so welcome! ,1
"The home was exactly as described and as depicted in the listing photos.  The property is clean, the beds are comfortable, the furnishings are nice, and the home was equipped with everything we needed for a comfortable stay.  The property is perfect for a family or a large group traveling in the area.  As noted in the listing, parking is extremely difficult, so I would explore the recommended app.  We experienced a hiccup in the check-in process, but the remainder of our stay was smooth.  Overall, I would recommend this property to guests searching for a comfortable stay in Boston.  ",1
"Helpful and friendly host, good place for family trip. Parking is hard to find around the house, just don't drive or reserve you parking spot before you arrive!",1
Dan's place was everything as advertised. It was clean and full of amenities. Great place to stay. Dan was also a great host - very responsive and available when needed. ,1
Great. As described. Would recommend!,1
"Very nice place, easy check-in, great hosts! Would recommend to anyone wanting to come to Boston with a group.",1
Nice place when I got there the cleaning lady was still cleaning so we actually helped her out instead of just watching her clean :) very nice place just like the pictures.,1
It was a great place to stay. I did not bring a car. The TV was set up very nice. ,1
"Had a pleasant stay.
The place is clean, simple, and comfortable.
Has access to anything you need.",1
"I loved this accommodation. We had a wonderful stay. The apartment is very modern, the beds are comfortable and everything was clean. I would definitely book it again. The neighborhood is also very nice. You have a grocery store very close and also some nice bars around (10min walk). And a bus is driving to downtown. Perfect!",1
"Dan was a great host and responded back quickly to every question and inquiry I had. His place was lovely and spacious, and the area was perfect for what my friend's and I were looking for. 

Highly recommend. ",1
"The space was just as described, very clean and new furnishings / fixtures. The skylight above the front stairwell, the back deck and the comfy living room made it a welcoming stay for three. Conveniently located with the best of Boston just a quick ride away. ",1
Dan had a fantastic apartment that was as described. He was quick to respond to any questions and made the process as seamless as possible. I would not hesitate to stay there again. ,1
This place is very spacious and looks even better than the pictures! My family and I had a very pleasant stay and Dan and Anya are very easy to communicate. The check-in and check-out process are also very convenient. I'm looking forward to returning in the future!,1
Dan did an extremely good job with the listing and helping us with places to go. The neighborhood was quiet but we were able to play music and did not get any noise complaints or anything. The beds were comfy and the futon was more comfortable than expected. We really enjoyed out stay. ,1
Dan and Anya were unbelievable hosts from their willingness to accommodate to our needs all the way to having the apartment stocked with all the necessities. The apartment was better then expected and gave off a very comfortable feel to be staying in. Next time I'm in the area of Boston their apartment will be the first place to look for on my list,1
"Awesome experience, very communicative and gave crystal clear instructions as well as helpful advice throughout my time at his place! 

All of his recommendations helped a lot, and it was a great experience overall!",1
Dan's apartment was perfect for us to spend the night. Very clean and tidy and such comfy beds! We had a lovely time and would definitely recommend it to all weary travelers.,1
Dan & Anya were great hosts. I've stayed at their Boston home twice now and have enjoyed both trips. They are very attentive and the house is clean and well cared for. I'd highly recommend this option. ,1
Dan was an incredible host! House was beautiful and very comfortable!,1
Listing very accurate! Great home,1
Dan was a tremendous host and made our housing accommodations extremely easy for our convention. We will look to do this again for next year! ,1
"Dan's place is exactly why I love Airbnb. My brother and our two small kids needed a place to stay for a night in Boston. Having a clean, convenient place with all of the comforts of home made it so much easier than a hotel. Even in the short amount of time we spent there, we got the taste of south Boston and Dan's hospitality. Super convenient to the airport. I'd highly recommend it!",1
"Great place to stay. Very helpful, organized, and professional.  Clean and very nice apartment.  Definitely recommend staying here.",1
"Listing was as described and it was a great place to stay. Its on a quite dead end street and I would stay there again. It was convenient to the city, quiet and way better than a hotel. ",1
Excellent place to stay. Clean and comfortable with plenty of room for the six of us. Convenient location in a nice neighborhood. Dan was a wonderful host. We would definitely stay there again. ,1
Dan was amazing hosting our group! He was always really easy to communicate and made us feel very welcome to his place! He sent all the information before we arrive and made everything clean and comfortable for us!,1
"We came for a conference in Boston and stayed at Dan's place. It was great - lots of space (3 bedrooms plus a main living room and a kitchen). It was cozy, very clean, and relatively close to the Boston Convention centre (about 20 minutes walking distance). It's in a residential area that we had never been to in Boston, so it was very convenient.",1
"Great host, Great space!",1
"The overnight parking situation is not ""tricky"" it's non existent.  Be prepared to pay $30- $40 to park in a garage 10-15min away and uber back.  The place itself was nice, rooms and bathrooms were clean.  A warning regarding the construction going on at 7am right outside the bedroom windows would have been nice.  We woke up startled to the sound of power tools and demolition directly outside the bedroom window.  There was no usable pan in the kitchen, the one that was there had rust all over it.  The place itself and the location was nice.  Take away the parking/Construction situations and it would have been a much better stay.",0
Very clean and comfortable. .would absolutely stay here next time..,1
"Overall, very good value for your money. We stayed for a week with a party of five for a congress in the nearby convention center. The distance and connection to the city center and the convention center was fine. For the five of us, the appartment was spaceous enough, the beds were all fine although replacement of the matras of the fold out bed in the livingroom seems to be due soon. The livingroom was too dark (lights didnt all seem to work) and it was quite hard to cook in the appartment since only very old cooking pans were available. Dan was a great host and all his recommendations were good!",1
The flat was very comfortable and we were very happy staying there. communication was very good and the trip was a huge success. The highlight (for me) was the recommendation to try the Yankee Lobster Eatery down on the waterfront - it was amazing !! Thank you for a lovely stay.,1
Very quiet and cozy apartment. Dan is very friendly and supportive. Wonderful experience. ,1
"Beautiful and quiet place to live in Boston. There are three bedrooms and one washroom, big enough for our four people. Very conveinent to go to downtown by bus and train. Dan is very welcome.",1
"Cool and good house
",1
"The listing and neighborhood was just as described: quiet and quaint. The place itself is nice and somewhat spacious, but not for 8 people. Yes, it CAN accommodate 8, but it definitely shouldn't. The bathroom rotations were more ridiculous than we had expected. There also seemed to be a problem with the drainage of the bathroom sink; turning the faucet on for a minute would almost have the sink overflowing. The majority of my group also felt that it was too dusty; sitting on a bed easily got lint all over our dark clothes. Everyone's allergies were also suddenly acting up due to the dusty feel when we first checked-in. The kitchen was nice but the table was not made for 8. My whole party could not eat together comfortable and we had to take turns at the dining table along with the bathroom. Anya was very friendly helpful. It was easy to reach her whenever a minor issue arose. Otherwise, it was a nice stay overall and I would recommend this to friends-who have a smaller party :)",0
Nice house and host!,1
"Dan communicated well and the space was as advertised. It was perfect for our group of 5 who were exploring the city. The deck was a great place to hang out in the morning and drink coffee. American Provisions, just around the corner, had great coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches, and snacks. If I'm back in Boston I would definitely return.",1
"The place was perfect for myself and my group of friends!!! Parking was a little tricky but that's to be expected.. The apartment was clean, easily found,   And check-in was as easy as could be. Would Deffinately reccomend. Everyone in my group was very pleased. ",1
Everything was perfect!,1
"Wonderful host. Nice and easy assess through text and phone. The apartment was good, quiet and cozy. But not highly-recommend for visitors with a car. Parking nearby is really difficult.",1
"A lovely apt located on very convenient location.
Dan is a very helpful host.",1
"Dan's place was very  accommodating for all 8 of us we had no problems with parking and it was in a great location very quiet neighborhood. Very clean comfortable beds very happy with the stay would stay in Dans place again
Thank you for everything 
",1
"Clean and roomy apartment, easy commute to downtown boston. Overall, great stay and would recommend to others!",1
"Had a great stay in Boston! Coffee in the morning and drinks at night on the patio were awesome. Perfect location to uber anywhere from. Is about a 20 minute walk to the closest T, but small cost to uber there. Great communication with Dan. Would definitely stay again!",1
Really good and clean place.,1
"We found the apartment as described and it was fully according to our expectations.
Just once minor remark, the cutlery was not for 8 people, but we managed.
To avoid misunderstanding: the apartment was to our satisfaction and we would book it again. In one word: recommended!",1
"We felt very welcomed by Dan.  He had ample information about the area, the house, and transportation options.  The listing was very accurate, with a complete manual in the house and  contact information if needed.  Access to the house and locking up information was clear.  The neighborhood was quaint.  We especially appreciated the easy walking to groceries, restaurants, and public transportation.  We had a wonderful Boston experience.",1
"The apartment was just the right size for my parents me and a 12 year old!

We lived the outdoor space and the proximity to the Safeway and other restaurants and  the cheese shop at the 
corner were great.

Great comfy beds too!

Parking is a bear so leave it at home and take the Uber or public transport!

Think about what you might need for cooking and then let Dan know! We needed a coffee grinder and would have loved wine glasses and a blender. Next time!",1
"The apartment was clean, beautiful, and on a quiet street.  Dan and Anya were very accommodating and provided everything we needed, including information on local restaurants, shops, and parking.  I would definitely stay at the apartment again!",1
"This was my first time staying in Boston, and Dan could not have been a more welcoming host. The home was incredible, and the location was perfect for exploring South Boston. Dan did a great job communicating with me throughout the process to make sure our group had a smooth trip, and it made the experience that much better. I highly recommend that anyone going to Boston stay here, they won't be disappointed.",1
"Dan and Anya were great, and answered questions quickly. The neighborhood was wonderful, and very close to everything we wanted to see in Boston. We ended up taking Lyfts most of the time because we had 7 of us, but it was usually less than $9 (each car) to get where we wanted to go. 

The space was just as described, and great for our needs. It was up a steep flight if stairs, which was ok, but I wish I had known sine we were traveling with my 75 year old mother. 

My only complaint was that the dishes were a bit dirty when we arrived. Dan let us come before the official check in time, so they may not have had enough time to get everything cleaned. 

I would stay there again. ",0
"I would highly recommend Dan's AirBnB as a great location to the Boston seaport surroundings.  As our first experience, it was a great and clean place to stay.  On a last minute trip with colleagues for a convention and all the hotels were booked -- there was plenty of space for three adults.  We wish we could have enjoyed our stay longer!  

Dan is very timely and responsive - he also had a great list of area places of interests and eats and true to explain the issues with parking if you drive.   I would book with him again the next time I'm in Boston for business or a family getaway. 
",1
"Really nice place - clean, light, accurately described in the listing.  Dan was always quick to respond. We all really liked the neighborhood.  It's about 8 blocks from the waterfront, which has a great path along it. And there are plenty of nice shops and restaurants close by. Relatively easy to get to from the airport.  The T stop (Boston's subway) is more than a mile away but there is a bus line that is really close.  There is also a Hubway station (the Boston bike share system) at the public library right around the corner so you can easily get a bike to ride around the area for $6. The listing said it was a very quiet neighborhood.  On Saturday night, one of the neighbors was playing music really loudly until around midnight.  It didn't bother us at all because we were up and hanging out on the patio (which is also really nice), but I'm not sure if the ""very quiet neighborhood"" description is entirely accurate.  At least not on that one particular night.",1
"This was a quiet oasis in busy Boston. Dan's apartment is well furnished with three private bedrooms. The memory foam beds were comfortable and the window unit air conditioners kept us cool while we slept.

We found the transit easy to get to downtown, taking the bus to the T station. Because our visit included Sunday, we were even able to find free parking on the street near the apartment for our car during our stay.  

We enjoyed drinking coffee on the back deck in morning.  The kitchen enabled us to make breakfasts at home in the morning before heading off for our day.  

The wifi was quick and much appreciated as we had a little work to do remotely before site seeing each day.

Dan left clear instructions and was easy to communicate with during our stay.

Thanks Dan!  ",1
Great host and apartment!,1
Dan was a great host! He was communicative and his house guide was thorough with tons of restaurant and coffee shop recommendations that were great for our group. The apartment was fantastic as well. Definitely recommend staying here!,1
Dan was a great host-- very responsive and easy to communicate with. I would absolutely book this place again.,1
"Dan and Anya attempted to be good hosts, but.... I travel constantly and have stayed at Airbnb's, hotels, and vrbos around the country. We loved the location here, however we did not feel as if the home was ""luxury,"" besides the fact that it had a large tv. We also felt most unwelcome due to our host's actions. The air mattress which was onsite had a hole in it and deflated immediately upon one of our group members inflating it and attempting to sleep on it. They attempted to charge us $200 for this air mattress after our stay, when clearly it had been damaged prior. To make matters worse, I personally stepped on a nail on the premises. I had to visit the doctor due to this incident with the nail and and believe that things such as this should be addressed/removed prior to allowing guests on the premises. Besides those two things, we loved the location. If we visit Boston again we will certainly stay in South Boston.",0
"The apartment is cozy and well furnished. It is also very well located, close to downtown and the beach and the neighbourhood is full of good restaurants. I will definitely come back!",1
"We had a great stay in Dan's place it was beautiful,  well equipped and excellent communication all the way. Great deck for bbqing. Had a ball! ",1
It was a nice safe place to stay. We were able to get around Boston quite easily. We tried the Moko and Lincoln restaurants nearby and they were awesome! There is a set of stairs to climb to get into the apartment so if you have a lot of luggage (like us travelling with two kids) then just plan ahead for it.,1
We spent a great weekend in Boston. The apartment matched exactly with the description. It was very convenient and we could really enjoy the city. Everything worked out very well. ,1
"Despite a late night plane being delayed an hour, a crash in the airport tunnel causing another hour delay, and the public transit train system also being shutdown due to a crash causing me to arrive around 2:30am, 3 hours later than I said I would, Orchid kindly greeted me with a water bottle and a few other things. Orchid is definitely a great host. I despite staying there for roughly 3 days, I never came across the mouse that was alluded to in other reviews. Location ~1 block away from public transit making it easy to get around.",0
"Pros: The room is very close to the metro station. Though in Dorchester, which apparently has a reputation of not being safe, I felt the area was safe during normal commuting hours. 
Neutral: 
Share one bathroom, kitchen, fridge etc with three other rooms which each have 1-2 people. 
Don't really get to know the other guests and everyone remains strangers. 
Very much a ""landlord"" and ""tenant"" atmosphere (i.e there are signs throughout the floor addressed to ""tenants"" and signed by the ""landlord"").  
I didn't meet the landlord until two weeks into my stay, and can't say it was under pleasant circumstances (i.e. the carbon monoxide detector alarm went off. It ended up being just a faulty detector or low batteries). 
General cleanliness (very old box-spring on ground, bed on top of box-spring, spider webs and dust behind bed, in corners of room, and under dresser.)
",0
Great accommodations! ,1
The location was convenient. Ahmed's associate Joe met me promptly to drop off a key and show me the place. The apartment itself is as advertised. ,1
"We have some positive things about this apartment. It is very well located, we walked almost everywhere. Eddie , Ahmed's assistant , is very friendly and did everything possible to make check in early . The appartment is well equipped for two and the bed is comfortable . 
Regarding the negatives: was poorly finished, quite dirty and dusty. Also had holes in the walls , and lights and outlets that did not work . 
As regards the building is very old and we needed to climb stairs to get there. It is particularly dirty and unkempt. It has central heating, so inside the department was warm sometimes and in several opportunities we had cold.",0
"An associate Eddie, met us at the apartment in good time after our arrival and showed us around our accommodations. The apartment was quaint as we new it would be however must be under construction as there were several holes in the walls (not shown in photos). Another thing we noticed as we were attempting to get ready the next day was that only two out of the several outlets were in working order. 
On the bright side the location in the city could not have been any better. We were within walking distance to Boston Common and the Public Gardens as well as the T station located in Boston Common. There was also a Starbucks on the block which was great! We were within walking distance to several amazing places to eat, the Prudential building as well as Newberry street for shopping. Although we were located right in the heart of the Theatre District which was hopping it was fairly quiet in the apartment. If you are looking for an authentic Boston experience I would definitely recommend staying here!",0
"The location is great for sight-seeing, it's close to downtown and many historical sights. The building looks run down but the apartment itself has been renovated. It is nothing special but everything works. Wi-fi access was fast. Downsides: the restroom was quite small, the toilet seat was too close to the wall to the point it's uncomfortable, the exhaust fan was very loud.",0
"This apartment is very well located and Eddy are really friendly .

Previous reviews were right when the finishing poorly made and cleanliness average . The bathroom should be renovated and the big holes left by the electrical work make the dubious apartment. Water was also cast light on the bathroom one morning. After a call to Eddy, a man came quickly .

In short, good communication, good staff, good location , apartment flawed .
",0
"Communication with host was good. It should be noted he is not the owner. It was downhill from there...

Apartment was terrible especially for the price they are asking. Entrance to building was filthy and there was construction debris scattered everywhere. Garbage in the hallway outside the apartment. Inside the apartment was a slight (and I mean slight) improvement. Bathroom was from the 1940's and shower had mould in it. There is drywall cut out throughout it in various spots, exposed electric panel (drywall cutout around it) - odd you don't see the drywall cutouts in the photos??!! I raised all of this with the host and got various excuses/reasons why for all of this. 

I stayed in it for 2 nights and had to leave. I asked for my money back and got nowhere. I realize Boston is an expensive city, but stay elsewhere. for $1100 USD I was HUGELY disappointed. ",0
"Stayed the weekend at Ahmed's place in Boston. Honestly,  there were some significant differences from the photos and description provided. Over a dozen holes in the walls,  most outlets didnt work,  no air conditioning were the major ones.  We weren't in the studio much so we still had a great trip. Location was good for visiting Boston. Basic amenenties provided.",1
"My stay was excellent, Ahmed was an excellent host and everything was exactly as described. The property manager Eddie met me at the front door for my check-in, ran me through all the ins-and-outs of the room, and also gave me some helpful tips for navigating the local area. 

Others have commented on the look of the apartment, but overall I didn't mind it at all. It's an older building, so expect a bit of wear and tear, but it had a full kitchen and fridge, the bed was comfortable and clean, and it was a GREAT location. The bathroom was a bit small, but it is a studio, so not unexpected. The price was really good for my stay as well, so all in all, I found it to be a perfect fit for what I needed. ",1
"We stayed in this apartment for 2 nights and were pleased with our time there. For whatever reason we found it quite difficult to communicate with our host on days leading up to our stay. We were hoping to check in a bit early and were unable to contact anyone until the day we arrived and fortunately finally talked to Ahmed who passed us on to someone who we coordinated our arrival with. Although temporarily frustrating, we were able to access the apartment without any further trouble and still a little bit early.

A small apartment with the basic necessities we enjoyed our short stay. It was nice being able to watch tv when it rained for a short time. Didn't have any soap or anything in the shower but all in all a good experience.",0
"This studio is a 3rd floor walk-up (so I hope you're traveling light) though it's located in a great part of town that is very convenient to the theatre district & Boston Common.  The building and unit itself, however, are still both very much in an ongoing state of renovation. If Ahmed had been a little more forthcoming about this fact in his listing, I'd have probably been a bit more understanding/less disappointed when I arrived, but since it was presented as being a good bit nicer than it was in actuality, well, suffice it to say that I was a bit disappointed upon my arrival. That being said, Boston is an expensive city and housing often seems to come at a premium, so whether you're on a budget or not, you're probably going to be hard-pressed to find anything private in this same area for less than $250 a night, so I suppose that it's best to be prepared for less than ideal accommodations if/when you do. If you're ok with the prospect of quasi economical urban camping, then you should be fine enough with this listing, but if you're looking for a place that's been wholly & completely renovated, or are simply accustomed to getting a good bit more bang for your buck as I have apparently become, then this place is probably not for you, at least not as of this posting. In the 4 years that I've been using AirBnB, this was one of the most expensive properties that I've ever booked, yet at the same time, it was of the lowest standards I've ever encountered. 
In addition to the frequent trash piles often left in the hallways of the building, the numerous holes in the walls, exposed outlets and dangling electrical wires, the bathtub also needs replacing as it is significantly stained and mildewed, and for some reason, the entire building also lost power for six hours one night. Additionally, despite booking an extra day into my reservation to provide for a morning check in, I was still kept waiting for over an hour after my arrival to actually be checked in. It was a challenging stay to say the least. Unfortunately, for this area of Boston, it seems that you're likely going to have to shell out significantly more money if you're looking for a genuinely nice place. I will most likely look elsewhere for accommodations the next time I'm in town. ",0
"The host was very easy to work with and very timely in response. During the visit we interacted with his assistant, who was very helpful and timely to accomodate our stay. Overall the listing is pretty accurate - it's definitely an older building and you can tell. However, it does exactly what you need it to - great place to sleep, clean, friendly, and a fantastic location. It's a great, central location to go explore Boston.",1
We came to enjoy the location in Chinatown and nearness to Common Park & Back Bay. Eddie the supervisor was of great assistance on various occasions! ,1
"This studio apartment served my purposes, particularly in it's location, but I have to say it was right at the edge of my creepy tolerance level. The studio itself is ok, although there are a few raw parts still in need of completion - and the bathroom is small in a way that makes the toilet challenging to use (normal sized person here). The window looks straight into a small well at other windows, and a fire escape stair is beside it. It's the entry and hallway in the building that is particularly sceevy, not that that is in Ahmed's control - but it is a factor. One should be used to some rugged accommodations before staying here.",0
"As the other comments mentioned, the building itself is not the most welcoming place with its exposed wires, trash bags in the hallways and dangling light fixtures. The apartment, however was much nicer. There were a few negative points (holes in the wall, stained/mildewed bathtub) but overall our experience was very positive. We had a great stay there, and you really can't beat the location: it is within walking distance of everything and a perfect place to explore the city when you're there for just a few days. It is right next to Boston Common and Chinatown, which offers plenty of choices for food. ",0
The location of this apartment is perfect. The apartment itself is not so nice. I think it is quiet expensive for what you get. ,1
Place was very practical and clean.,1
"Getting the keys from the host was a bit harder then expected as we waited for him for quite a while and that part of the communication was not very well done.

The apartment was clean, had the amenities mentioned, everything was as described on the page. Fantastic location! ",1
"The most important matter is always communication.  Ahmed did a great job of keeping in touch before and during our stay.  He ensured someone was available to check us in, show us around, and make us feel welcome.  They were quick to respond to my questions.
They've done a nice job re-modeling the cozy apartment in this old building in Boston, and the location in the city is unbeatable.  If 2 people on a budget are looking for a great place to stay in the city, this cannot be beat.",1
"Ahmed and his associate Eddie were excellent at communicating and responding to any problems. Great hosts. The apartment was as pictured, but the unit receives almost no daylight, if that is a factor. If location is important, it is really smack dab in the middle of the Theater District...great location. ",1
"Great location, no problems with anything.  The apartment is small, but this unit was about 1/2 the rent of the next closest apartment.  We were met by Eddie to get in and he was patient and knowledgeable.  The biggest negative was that the hallways were a little shabby, didn I mention that it was very inexpensive?  ",1
"Ahmed was great: fast and direct communication. Location was also ideal - right near the T. CANNOT beat the price. The room was as advertised; no more, no less. Though he's consistent in answering the phone, don't let Eddie (a nice guy) tell you he'll call you back - get a final answer when you have him on the phone the first time.",1
Great little apartment within walking distance of everything in Boston. Would definitely stay again,1
Great little apartment with the perfect location to explore Boston. Ahmed has been a great host!!,1
"NEGATIVES.
1) I never met Ahmed, only Eddie, his friend...
2)Ahmed is very precautions,  no calls, no sms, no (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN).. weird and lots of drama.
3)The apartment is smaller what I was thinking about. expensive because the buiding is really in bad conditions.
4) Every morning waking up at 8 am, workers making noisies fixing the building. It was compulsory and I demanded as a priority DO NOT BE DISTURBED, and next day I checked in, he said they will be fixing the building.
5) After checking in I didn't have any contact with Ahmed, I was complaining about the noise and I texted Eddie, and he said he doesn't work with that ) that Ahmed is the one dealing with reservations trying to find if he can find another apartment. Ahmed said no, and I didn't like his way just asking for me to explain and he was giving me silly reasons saying that the noisies from the apartment above probably they took the carpet out and that's why I hear the woman walking.
6) 2 floors by stairs, Forget it if u have big suitcase like me! No elevator because building is very old.
7) The bathroom need renovation URGENTLY, decoration from 30 s.

POSITIVES.
1) Hot water in shower and restroom in just seconds.
2) Location is very central.
3) Eddie brought an iron as I requested.
4) Eddie is very sympa.",0
"All the good reviews are true and the apt is just as pictured, but unfortunately the review about construction noise is also true, at least currently (Dec 2015). 
Good news is future renters will have brand new windows, bad news is I was the one woken at 7:30 am and told to leave the apt because they were putting them in, followed by ungodly noise as they broke the windows across the airshaft so I couldn't just refuse and go back to sleep. 
With a noon checkout I think it's reasonable to expect to sleep till 10, but if you need to I'd suggest waiting till Feb 2016 or so before trying this building (though I bet he can charge more once the work is finished). If you're an early riser this is not a problem, and otherwise the price and location can't be beat.",0
"My stay at Ahmed's was convenient, simple, and easy. Communication and check-in & out were all done simply through text. The location was prime! The stairs are a bit shotty in the building; but the apartment is wonderful and makes up for it. Everything you need is stocked and available inside. Overall I was happy with my stay and would most certainly book Ahmed's place again and again! ",1
"Check in at 3pm was very punctual. The neighborhood was awsome and right in the middle of the historical trail and theater district.  The apartement was warm and cozy. 
Cons: 
- the bathroom is DISGUSTING. black stains in the tub, dirty vents. but the worst was the toilet: it was so near the sink on the right and the wall on the left that you litteraly don't have space to ""sit"" properly (my elbows would hit the sink or the wall when i tried to wipe!). 
- the foam in the matress was really thin, you could feal the wood underneath
- the apartment was dirty. there was dust over the kitchen and the fridge that looked like it had been accumulating during months! i dont know why i paid for cleaning service...
Final balance: not worth the money i paid.",0
Everything promised was delivered. The place was great and the location was ideal for us. Would definitely stay again on a future visit. ,1
"We stayed for a 8 nights while vacationing and visiting some friends. Eddie met us at the check-in time and was very welcoming. The location of the studio is wonderful - very close to Boston Common and multiple T lines. Getting around was really easy via subway or walking.  
The building is old and the neighborhood can be a little noisy at night....frequent sirens due to fire/medical nearby. The bathroom is small and shows wear, and the air vent could use a cleaning, but we found everything functional and when problems arose, Eddie and the building super responded very quickly. The mattress was a thin Ikea one as other reviewers have noted, but we slept fine. It was nice to have the small kitchen and decent-sized fridge so we didn't have to eat out for every meal.  
Overall, we found this studio to be great for our stay and we would stay there again.",0
"We had a great time staying here! The location is right in the middle of everything! You walk out and can head straight down to the park. Tons of restaurants in walking distance. We loved it. 

If you're looking for a brand new, modern type of stay, this is not for you. The bathroom needed some improvements, but didn't bother us at all because we weren't in Boston to stay in a room all weekend, we were there to explore the city! It was perfect for our purposes. 

The hosts were wonderful! The building manager let us store our bags before we could check in, we had an early check in and they installed a window air conditioner when it got too hot!

For the price and location, I'd definitely recommended and stay again!",1
"This place was perfect! I could not have asked for a better location. Right down the street from Boston Commons, everything was in walking distance or just a short Uber ride away. 

Ahmed and Eddie were very easy to work with and accommodating when our flights got in a little earlier than planned, and check-out was very easy!

I highly recommend this small studio if location is at the top of your list for your Boston visit.   ",1
"Well I had read the other reviews so I was prepared for the shabbiness of the building but it was REALLY SKEEVY.  I never met the host, or the elusive Eddie (friend of host) but they had keys all ready to go for me, and someone came to let me into the building no problem.  That person and Eddie were very nice and responsive.  The apartment was fine other than it really needed cleaning (food and dirt on floor in kitchen, hair in shower that wasn't mine) and the mattress is beyond bad, thin wasn't the issue it just has huge dents from being overused.  You get what you pay for with this place.  Great location but CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED.  ",0
"Great location and value. Easy, no hassle check-in / check-out.",1
Amazing location and about what I expected from reading other reviews.  Perfect for my travel needs on this trip.,1
"Ahmed does not personally deal with this apt. As others mentioned there are other associates like Eddie and Kevin doing the hands on business. The apt is very old; the shower on arrival did not work at all, but they fixed it in no time by sending a ""plumber"" that lived in the same house. So +1 for that responsiveness, but -1 for not checking before we arrived.

In general the place is kinda dirty and does not feel it gets the attention it deserves. Bathroom and main room are affected by that similarly - including the fridge and kitchen elements.

Good part is that the apt is really in good chinatown/downtown boston location.

Due to our problems we had to change to the hostel near by. I would recommend to not rent this place especially if you are not travelling alone or if you want a clean place. The bed is too small to accommodate two comfortably and the bathroom is also very tiny with toilet being almost under the sink.

Thanks!
",0
"Just perfect for us , really good situation , cosy ... Perfect for a couple ",1
"The place was very nice and confortable.
Very central and good location to explore the city.",1
Great location and price. The room is clean and the location is fantastic!,1
"Ahmed did a great job accommodating me and was readily available to give me access to the unit when I arrived.  

The unit itself is accurately depicted in the photos but is located in a very run down building - not a problem, but worth knowing.  It's also worth noting that there is no elevator and the building entrance door does not lock.  The unit was clean and air was fresh (despite cigarette smelling hallways).  The bathroom is clean, but very old (shower/bathtub needs a face lift).

Overall, I was pleased with the experience and the unit's location is excellent.  It's within walking distance to everything.  Great for someone travelling on their own.

Thank you Ahmed!",0
"The studio is a bit rough, but a good value for the money because it is clean and in a great location right near Boston Commons and the Boylston T.  The bed could be more comfortable, but if you are not a light sleeper, go for it!",1
Great location and clean. Very responsive. Had a great time.,1
"A little bit of a late start to checking in because of rain, but overall Eddie (one of Ahmed's associates) was very accommodating and friendly about getting me in as soon as possible. The location seems sketchy at first, but the longer I stayed the more comfortable I felt. The building is old, and that's something you have to take into consideration upon entering! Overall, I would stay again. It was a great location central to everywhere. ",1
"The landlord is very nice,and I like the decorations in the house.
But I think that if the sound-proofing can be Stronger is better.
In short, it is a nice place!☺️",1
The apartment was clean and the perfect size for two people. The location is amazing and I'd definitely stay here again. ,1
Great place for what it's worth. ,1
"Lovely home, accommodating host!  Thomas offers a stay in a gorgeous home in the perfect city location.  An  amazing roof top terrace offers a beautiful view of the  Charles River and the flat is located within walking distance of the myriad of Charles Street shops, as well as, much of the rest of the city.  For further exploration, the subway, trolley, and bus system are equally accessible.  As we were in the city for a family gathering, our time with Thomas was limited; however, for those unfamiliar with the city, he definitely would be able to offer advice and suggestion as to making the most of your Boston experience.  We would definitely consider another stay!",1
Tom was a wonderful host..felt like I was family from the first day.. location doesn't get any better..great space.. highly recomend his place. ,1
"Our host knew it was our first visit to Boston and made every effort to make us welcome.  We arrived late in the evening and he met us outside the front door to make sure we got in OK.  He proceeded to take us on a short tour of the neighborhood, and Beacon Hill is wonderful.  His hometown and neighborhood  knowledge helped us tremendously and we found our way around with relative ease and enjoyed some of the local establishments at his recommendation.  

The space was nice with rooftop access offering a place to relax and enjoy tremendous views of the city.  I hope to be back to Boston in the near future and would be lucky to find his place available.  The value was worth it.",1
"I enjoyed very much to stay at Thomas' place. It was a nice, clean room and the location is excellent. Thomas was a very nice host and it was no problem for me to arrive very late on my arrival day and to leave my luggage until afternoon on my departure day. Overall, a very pleasant stay and I will definitely check if Thomas has a room free next time I come to Boston.",1
"We had a lovely time at Thomas' place! Exquisite building, great location, and welcoming hospitality!! His dogs and kitten were adorable, we just loved them. He had some great tips about where to go and if our schedule wasn't so packed we would have done all of it! Oh, and the rooftop deck was awesome!",1
Thomas is a really great and fun guy. His pets are adorable and the apartment is in the best possible location. Great days in Boston!,1
"Thomas is a great host, very friendly, entertaining, and caring. The location is amazing (walking distance to many restaurants, shops, and to the main tourist attractions). The dogs were very quiet and lovingly. Finally, the view from the roof-top terrace is amazing - 360 degree view of Boston and Cambridge!  ",1
Thomas was a great host! He was very accommodating and made sure that I was comfortable throughout my stay. I would definitely recommend staying with him If you're in the Boston/Cambridge area.,1
"Tom's place is great!  Just down the street from MGH.  I'm a nurse there and I needed a convenient place to sleep between long shifts.  Tom's apartment is extremely clean and has everything you need to be comfortable -- including two cute puppies who like to cuddle.  Tom is kind, informative, and very accommodating.  I placed my request on the same day that I needed the room and it wasn't a problem.  I would highly recommend staying at Tom's.",1
"This is one of those places and host that you hope to find on AirBnB. Impeccable furnishing and cleanliness; simply beautiful views and hood. 

If you get a chance stay here",1
"Tom was very nice, social, and accommodating. The location was ideal to get to MGH quickly and even closer to public transit. Everything was clean and comfortable in the apartment, and the building is very nice. The dogs and cat are curious and very sweet. Views from the rooftop are beautiful. ",1
"Staying Thomas' place was a really exceptional experience. If there was an award for the best air bnb host, he would definately get my vote.
The room and the bathroom was super clean. You can feel that Thomas really put lots of efforts to make sure you have a great stay. The location is great as well, very close to most tourists attractions and 5 minutes from the nearest t line. i really recommend this place when you come to Boston.",1
Tom was very accommodating to my request at the last minute. Very warm welcome and covered all details on how to navigate the apartment and building and made a obvious effort to make me comfortable during my short stay. He even let me borrow his Charlie Card! ,1
Beautiful home in Beacon Hill close to the Charles. Thomas is a helpful and friendly host. I needed to print some documents for work while I was staying with Thomas and he helped me set up and use his printer. Also ready with suggestions for great places to go and eat in the neighborhood.,1
"Great area.  Within walking distance of a lot of different sites. Also a few minutes from the subway.  
Thomas was very nice and accommodating.  He has a wealth of knowledge about the area and is very eager to share.  
The house itself is very nice.  Beautiful home that has been cared for.
The only ""complaint"" i could make would be that it was very warm in the home.  Personal preference, so no big deal.",1
"Thomas was a great host! Every detail was carefully arranged, making the stay a pleasure.  The location is perfect and I would definitely recommend the place.  Special mention to the two sweet doggies of the house who also made the stay more enjoyable, bring them some treats!",1
"We had a great stay at Thomas' place. Beautiful and very clean space. 
Located in Beacon Hill, Thomas' apartment is perfect to discover Boston. Also, Thomas was a great host, he gave recommendations and shared his story with us. 100% recommend the stay at his place!",1
"Thomas was a wonderful host.  This was the second night, booked separately, that I stayed at his lovely home and it was perfect. As stated in my previous review, his welcoming graciousness and accommodating hospitality really helped me through a difficult time. I was not in Boston on pleasure in fact, my mom was in the hospital so he helped to ease some of the stresses associated with that. 
Thank you Thomas!  I would stay again and will certainly recommend both his home and Airbnb to friends! ",1
"Best AIRB&b experience! 
Really cool historic building in the heart of historic Boston. Walking distance to antique shops, restaurants and Boston commons park. 
Thomas was very nice, friendly and with lots of stories to share. I wish we had more time to stay and learn more about historic Boston from him. 
The roof top is spectacular! Great for enjoying Boston views over coffee or brunch. ",1
"Great neighborhood, kind and friendly host. Very positive experience.",1
"The location and deck are both fabulous.  Re: accommodations, I'd recommend: 
- getting curtains that can block light more effectively
- outfitting closet with nicer hangers
- this may be difficult to fix but there is a fairly strong dog pee odor.  This could turn off a # of people",0
"Thomas was great.  Helped me find a dry cleaner, offered a cold beer on a hot day and truly cared about helping me out and ensuring I had a comfortable stay.  His two dogs are super cute and his home perfect location to some of the best of Beacon Hill.  Clean home.  Great price and comfy bed.  Just as promised. ",1
"Pretty room & bath, beautiful historic building, fantastic location, very attentive host. Many thanks to Thomas for an excellent stay.",1
"Thomas made sure he met me to help me find my way into the apartment, even though I was a bit later arriving than expected. He gave me lots of information about local places. The area is perfect - really central to shops, cafes, restaurants, walks and public transport. The apartment is beautiful. ",1
"Thomas was a great host.  He was communicative, generous and helpful.  ",1
"Thomas is a great guy, makes you feel welcome and really makes his apartment yours for the days you are there. The room is clean and the roof terrace is fantastic for time to think. I would certainly stay again.",1
"Thomas was a terrific host! Not only was he accommodating and open to me dropping off my bag prior to check in, but he was a wealth of Bostonian knowledge. He knew how to get everywhere and was available to help me with my many questions. His place is an excellent location and I'd recommend staying in beacon hill to anyone looking for a central location. ",1
"Thomas did make us feel welcome, and he is quite knowledgeable on Boston.  ",1
"Great location.  Right in a old town next to Little Italy.   Difficult to find parking, however.   ",1
nice place,1
Great experience for our first time using air bnb. The apartment is in a great location and walkable to Copley square and Boston Commons. Wes is a great host and very responsive when we had a question or two. ,1
"Wes was very communicative via email and phone to make sure we could access the apartment and get settled in. This apartment is a phenomenal location on Comm Ave, walking distance to green line T stops, Copley Square, Newbury Street, Kenmore Square - basically perfectly located in Back Bay. The apartment was cozy and charming, great shower and kitchenette. The mattress is quite firm but very comfortable - not a problem for us. Also of note  is the décor which gave the room a charming character (grandfather clock, old paintings, wood floors). Overall this is a fantastic find and I would recommend to anyone visiting Boston.",1
Great place in a great location! The room was big enough for 3 people. ,1
Anthony's place is really convenient; close to the subway and downtown Dorchester. Place was heated and he provided bottled water.,1
"Nice and confortable place, excellent bed, heated, wi fi, cleaned, less than 2 minutes to the subway station. Anthony was super  friendly with us, and even after our stay was done, he accepted us again in the middle of the night when our bus was cancelled. I would definitely stay with him if I ever go to Boston again.",1
"Anthony was a great host! Everything was easily accessible, room was clean and as described. He even offered bottled water, food, and toiletries. Apartment is very close to the T and Anthony's family was very nice! ",1
"Anthony is a friendly man,he give us a lot of suggestion. And the house is so good,close to subway,and room is super worm. The Chinese family hospitable. When we arrived Boston,it
was Chinese New Year,they provided us a lot of Chinese food.",1
"Excellent experience, very nice and clean and 3mins from the T, perfect. Anthony was super Nice !",1
I'm not very satisfied of that place... They are nice people but I had trouble sleeping because of the radiator that was so noisy and they made me pay 5$ for a towel... ,0
"It is near T station , the house is really comfortable and nice . I am enjoy the time during in Boston .",1
Anthony and the family there were very nice to us. The room is clean and tidy. I saw him taking a long time vacuuming. I stayed at both rooms. This one is bigger than the other. So I got enough space to unpack our two large pieces of luggage. And the apartment is really close to the T. It makes the apartment an excellent choice especially for the travelers who have a lot of luggages. I definitely will choose to stay here next time.,1
"Anthony was friendly, he left us leave bags in the room before check-in. Room looks like on the pictures - nice, clean and warm, and it is quite big. Location is super convinient, metro station is just across the street (2min) and it takes abut 10min to south station.",1
"Nice host, nice room, nice location, nice choice.",1
I chose to stay here for nearly one week. Apparently it is a nice place to stay.,1
"Very warm and cozy room, in a amazingly convenient location! Anthony was helpful in answering all our questions. We wouldn't hesitate to stay with him again next time we're in Boston!",1
"Our stay in Anthony's apartment was great! Everything was clean and the room is very large. It is so easy to get to from the subway, only a 1 minute walk. Overall a very good place to stay when visiting Boston! ",1
My boyfriend and I had a great experience staying here! The room was clean and comfortable for our short stay. It was easy to find and very convenient. We'll definitely stay here again next time we come to Boston! ,1
"It's a very nice room in a good location in Boston, I could easily get to places I wanted to see in the city.  However the review does not state that there is a family living here, who were perfectly fine but I prefer to stay in places away from small kids.  Just a heads up",0
"We enjoyed our stay. Anthony communicated well and was well organized. Room was clean, well lit, sunny, warm. Bed comfortable. Desk, drawers, closet, small sofa, bottled water included. Plenty of space for 2. Room is part of 3 bedroom apartment with one shared bathroom. Anthony's family of four live in the apartment, but were away for most of our stay.  A second, smaller bedroom had another airbnb couple for the weekend. Apartment is on 3rd floor, 4 flights of steep stairs from street level. Received large, clean, soft bath towels when requested. Savin Hill T close and convenient. From Logan, take SL1 to South Station and then Red Line to Savin Hill. Close to Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants on Dorchester Ave. Savin Hill Bar & Kitchen restaurant close and good too. Not aware of hot tub, washer or dryer, but did not ask about them. Close to shore line (water), nice for walking or running. Apartment is right on freeway but noise did not bother us. Might be more of an issue if windows were open. Overall enjoyed our stay and would like to stay again next time we are in Boston. Thanks to Anthony and his family for welcoming us into their home!",1
Very convenient location and nice room!!! Recommendation!,1
"I don't have much to add to these other reviews.  They and the photos are quite accurate.  The house is indeed literally a one minute walk to the Savin Hill T stop.  I was attending a meeting at the convention center and this was a fantastic way to save money and still be reasonably close to the meeting.  You could even take a taxi from Anthony's house and still come out WAY ahead of booking a hotel by the convention center.    

The bed was comfortable, there is plenty of closet space, a desk, bottled water provided, functional wi-fi/internet.  A great, basic accommodation.  If you go into this space not expecting a hotel and realize you're paying a very good price for a place to stay in Boston, I doubt you will be disappointed.

The truth is, I barely saw Anthony.  I saw him for a total of maybe 30 seconds, but when I did see him, he was quite friendly.  We stayed in touch via text message (prompt responses) and I had no problems with him as a host.   A had a few questions that were responded to quickly.

I kept to the room, but didn't feel unwelcome to use the living room.  That said, there are other people in this space.  Anthony's sister and her young child (adorable).  There is also another room that gets rented out.  There seemed to be only one bathroom, so waiting for the bathroom might be an issue from time to time for some, but was not an issue for me.

Also, the living room had quite a lot of clutter in it given the small kid and her toys and craft projects and whatnot, however, again, this is not something that bothered me as I used this space primarily for sleeping and kept to the bedroom which was clean and orderly when I arrived.  However, if you're someone who is looking for a common space to hang out in during your stay (i.e. not your bedroom), you might prefer a different setting.

Lastly, I was worried that highway noise would be a problem after seeing the photos for the listing.  The house does literally overlook the highway.  However, at least with this particular bedroom, I did not find it intrusive at all.  I also sleep with white noise (from my phone), so maybe take that with a grain of salt, but even when that wasn't on, I did not find highway noise to be an issue.  

Thanks Anthony!",1
"Although it's my 1st time in Boston and was a very short stay for a night, I had a very great welcoming from Anthony.He's very kind and full of service minded, helped me alot such as giving pieces of advice for restaurant, places to visit or even how to access to his house. He also cared about me during my travelling alone in Boston by texting me to keep update about my (URL HIDDEN) more big thing was he helped driving me to the Airport early morning at 04:30 to take a flight to Washington D.C. For the accommodation, the room was so clean, had enough space to relax and keep stuffs, bathroom was also nice to use. It was easy to access to any places by taking red line metro,the station was about 2-3 mins walk from the house.I love this place and if I have a chance to visit Boston again, I will definitely stay at his place. Thanks alot again for your big help and warm-hearted welcoming that made my trip in Boston so wonderful.",1
The room is nice and clean. Location is nice. And the hosts are really nice!!,1
"Anthony was very nice and gave us some good advice touring the city. The room is cozy and just really a good place to sleep when you are done with a busy day. Location wise, so close to the train stop, highly recommended if you dont want to walk for a while before you hit bed. Overall, would def stay again next time in Boston.",1
"The room was very clean, although I didn't get to meet Anthony he responded to my questions. There is a family living, be aware for bathroom time. the bathroom needed much cleaning! 
Only Anthony speakers English, therefore ask all your questions before you get there!",0
"Anthony was a great host and the room was perfect for for our visit. It was only a minute or two walk to the train and in a nice area of the city. Walkable restaurants and a drug store. There is a small beach at the bottom of the hill that was great to walk to and eat lunch and relax for a while. I had questions for Anthony regarding the stay and the area, as our trip got closer and he was very helpful in answering them.",1
"We had a wonderful time at Anthony's. The place is clean,  confortable and very near the highway and the train station. He was there when we arrived to show us the house and offered his assistance at all times, even before we get there.",1
Flat is good located and Anthony is very friendly..,1
"We stayed in Anthony´s apartment for a week. The room was clean and had air conditioning and wifi. We had a busy schedule and didn't spend much time at ""home"". The proximity to the Savin Hill tube station (red line) made our travels easy. Anthony was easy to get in touch with through internet and available to answer any questions we had. Other family members, living in the apartment, spoke very little English but were friendly. An overall good experience!
P.s. If you are a bad sleeper you might want to bring earplugs because the apartment stands next to a highway.",1
Room was nice. Only one minute away from the subway. Anthony was also very nice.,1
"Andrew was very nice and attentive. The bedroom was clean, the bed was comfortable. I recommend him for anyone who wants to stay in Boston.",1
Our stay at Anthony's house was so nice. We didn't meet him but he was always available by the phone. The room was clean and very close to the subway. ,1
Very good experience with Anthony's apartment :) perfect location just in front of the subway and he left waters and soups for us :) thank you:) ,1
Great Location!,1
Awesome place. Very convenient. Right next to the train. Great bars and restaurants in walking distance. Would definitely stay again,1
"This location is amazing! Steps from both the subway (the T) and the beach, which is so convenient. As far as the actual room goes, it was clean and good for a night's sleep. The apartment is on the third floor so it could be an inconvenience if you have a lot of luggage. Also, the apartment can get pretty warm in the summer time, but there is an A/C in the room which is definitely nice. I didn't have any interaction with Anthony during our stay, but he was very responsive to questions before our arrival. Overall, it was a great place to stay and I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again if I ever find myself in Boston. ",1
"We had a little bit of a complicated start, I didn't had Internet to receive the code to the door, but after that was resolved the stay was a breeze. 
The room was spacious and clean, a little bit noisy, but nothing to be scared about. 
The family was very welcoming and helped a lot. 
Good shower, good bed, good air conditioner. Don't need to ask for nothing else. ",1
Anthony was very good and communication and helpful with check in and out. Didn't actually met him. The people in the property we very friendly although didn't speak English. The room was spotless and had air con. Location was perfect less than 5 min walk to subway so really easy to get into centre and some really nice restaurants close by. The road noise didn't bother us at all.,1
"I didn't get to meet Anthony personally, but I did reach him easily on the phone when contacting him about checking in! His family welcomed me and my cousin into the home and we got situated easily. The room was great-just as advertised, and the air conditioner worked well after a long day out on the town. His house was right across from the subway, that was easy to navigate and took us downtown. In the morning his aunt was very kind and made us breakfast! Anthony's place was very accommodating and I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing to stay in Boston!",1
"Anthony was very reliable and answered  all my questions with quick response. 
His aunt quickly made the room when I arrived early in the morning.",1
"I didn't meet Anthony face to face but everything was done to ease our stay and arrival even in late arrival due to flight delay.
Anthony family was nice and the room was as described.
Clean room, comfortable bed, air conditioned and nice neighborhood...(Mc Kennas cafe is a great place to have good breakfast)
Very close to Red Line  and 20min from downtown by subway.
Nice location in Boston!",1
"Even I didn't see Anthony during the days I spend at his home, but he actually did everything for me to live better. It is so convenient to the Metro station and also, Boston is such a place that you can get anywhere you want with a metro station. thanks! Hope can come back again! ",1
"The room was as described. It was very loud because of the Highway directly in front of the house. The T-Station was in 2 minute Walk distance. Anthony organized everything perfectly for us, but we did not meet him face2face. The communication with his family members was hard, they dont speak english. ",0
The location is great just a minute walk to the T and there is a beach just minutes away as well as jogging paths.   We didn't see Anthony but everything was as described in the posting.  He and his wife were readily available by email and cell to answer questions we had.  The on street parking was very convenient.,1
Overall it was good and best thing was accessible to T stop.,1
The place is a few minutes walk from the metro line that takes you directly to the city centre and Harvard (around 20mins). The host was very responsive and the lady who cleans the place was absolutely lovely and incredibly helpful.,1
Thank you Anthony! Everything was very comfortable. The house was very conveniently located near the subway so it was easy to get around.,1
it is very noisy but OK,0
"Good place for a quick visit to Boston, literally 2 minutes from subway station. Anthony is a very nice host, quick and accurate in his communications.",1
Enjoyed my stay. Would recommend it. ,1
"We were very happy with how quick Anthony was to respond to our messages. Anthony’s home was very clean and convenient to downtown. The room was warm and cozy, and everyone we saw (other travelers, Anthony’s family) were very nice. It is noisy, but for us it was good background noise to fall asleep to. You might have to wait for the bathroom, but otherwise it’s a great place to stay!

The place is cozy and clean. Very convenient location next to the red line. Everything is good except that it is very noisy at night since it is so close the the highway.,0
"we didn't see Anthony but he left us precises instructions to get the keys. his family is nice but they dont speak much english. the room is as pictured, neat and clean, as the shared bathroom. 
the only but is the noise. the house is near the road and the railways. for us it was ok to stay at boston.",0
Anthony was a really nice and friendly host. You can get really fast to the train and to south station. (FYI: The last train goes around midnight). Unfortunately the toilette and our room were not very clean. ,0
"A good place to stay,and very near to the metro station.I left my watch in the (URL HIDDEN),Anthony informed me of this.",1
"Very good location, 5 minutes walking from the subway station.

The room was very sunny and clean. We had enough space. There's a small desk, small furniture to hang your clothes and a mini sofa. It was all very convenient. 

Anthony perfectly explained us how to reach the house and get the keys, it was all very easy. 

Nevertheless, there's a little negative point, the room is pretty noisy. There's the highway just close by the house. But with ear plugs, we slept perfectly.

It was a very nice place to stay for visiting Boston !!",1
Anthony had sent us perfect information before we came. Unfortunately at that time we hadn't understood that the text message we had received was not the complete information and that the lacking part was standing in an extra email- thus when we arrived it took us a bit of time to understand how everything was going on ;-) The room was nice and clean and the public transport into Boston very easy. Just for people who are very sensitive to noise it can be very loud because of the nearby highway .,1
"The room is very bright and it is only two steps to the train that brings you downtown Boston! For that I recommend it to those who want to get easily to the city because it's not far at all! 
I was there with my boyfriend just for one night but honestly if we had booked for more nights I would have rather spent the double of the price and booked a hotel room... the bathroom was very dirty, hairs all over the floor and we wouldn't have managed to have a shower there if we weren't together! We didn't want to touch anything indide the bathroom! And since there it lives a family we didn't feel comfortable to use the kitchen and other spaces in common....
Anyway the room was clean, but since it is beside a high traffic road and the train it is noisy as hell! We were tired, that's why we had no problem to sleep!",0
"Location of this house is really perfect. 2 min to subway on foot and and with subway you can reach wherever you want. Anthony and his family is kind and hospitable. The only problem is that they don't English except Anthony. Sometimes it can be hard to communicate with them cuz or that. He also allowed us for late check-in. However, on our last day nobody was at home and we had little problem to take out luggages from his home. To sum up, i recommend this pretty house, you won't be regret. Thank you for your hosting Anthony!",1
"Although we didn't meet Anthony personally, we had a pleasant stay at his appartment. The room was clean and big, the AC worked fine but earplugs are a must if you're a light sleeper. We didn't use the kitchen and the bathroom is shared with all the rooms. 
The communication with Anthony is great, he responded very quickly to every message and when we arrived, a family member was there to show us the room (not speaking English but we managed to communicate :)). It was a good experience overall.",1
"I thought that my first Airbnb experience was okay. I really liked the room at Anthony's place, but right, the noise outside next to the highway was extremely disturbing. But then, the location being accessible to the public transportation was awesome, and the price was reasonable. I wouldn't go back to it just because I found the bathroom floor not clean at all for having a guest over. But I would prefer coming here than choosing a hotel because I felt safer and more like home in this place.",0
"We stayed at Anthony’s place for 4 nights. It was our first Airbnb experience and after that, maybe our last.

We actually never met Anthony but only had contact with his family (as least we thing it was his family). She could barely speak english and we had a really hard time communicating. 

When we arrived we found hairs in the bed. There was no flat sheet, only a fitted sheet. We had to sleep with the duvet cover in direct contact. They were no other blankets and the room gets really cold as it it drafty. There was a bad smell in all of the appartement.


The worst part; The bathroom. It was smelly moldy and overall dirty. There was hair on the floor and the sink. The walls were covered in dirt and leftover glue from message that were glued on the walls. All hand towels were wet and smelly so we had nothing to dry our hands after washing them. The bathtub was moldy and very dirty. There is no fan in the bathroom and the window was always left closed so it smelled bad. We always felt dirtier after leaving the bathroom. The sink counter was always covered in water that was droping on the floor. The bath mat was always soaking wet. Towels were not provided. The timeframe to use the bathroom was also impossible. Since we couldn’t communicate with the family, we never knew when it was ok to take showers or even go to the bathroom. There was only one bathroom for everybody so it was almost always in use. When it wasn’t, it was even dirtier than before. Each morning, after the family used the bathroom, the lady would use the bathroom sink to clean and rinse her mop, there was brown dirt water and hair everywhere. Only after that we could use the bathroom and by then, it was almost 9;00. We tried to take our showers at night but the bathroom was also always in use. 

We were also supposed to have acces to the kitchen but it was so dirty  (food from the night before still on the table, plastic bags full of stuff on the counters) and there wasn’t any space for us. We only wanted to put a take out box in the fridge and there weren’t any space.   The pictures that you can see on the page are clearly of before they moved into the appartement

The pictures are also not of the present bedroom used. Furniture is not all the same. 

We would not go back. The price of the room is high for such a bad experience. It is also very noisy, even with earplugs we could ear the Highway.
",0
Although my girlfriend and I never got to meet Anthony check in went smooth with the instructions provided. Our stay was pleasant! The room was big and clean and the bed comfortable. One night it was pretty cold  and we were provided with an extra heater which we really appreciated! Communication with the Family that also lives there was minimal because of not speakng English. Nevertheless we felt welcome all the time.,1
I never met Anthony.  He emailed after 1030 at night to see if I had any questions. ,1
"I like the fact that location was very convenience to a train also close to many restaurants and grocery store. The room was ok and price was reasonable. Host was nice even though we couldn't communicated but she tried her best to help and also we got a little girl helping to translate. Be Careful if you are living room#3 door knob couldn't be locked from inside it would like a trap and it took us to open the door like 30 mins. There was only 1 bathroom in the apartment ( We have to say that as We don't think it is a house, it look more like 3 bedroom apartment to us) it could be traffic to use a bathroom and it's not clean enough!!!! Rugs were wet, toilet bowl cover had some sticky black dirt on it. I gave 3/5 as everything was quite nice if comparing with the price. ",0
"Anthony's place was nice, Family members that lived there were also friendly. Anthony was very helpful with communication and made sure everything was okay.  The bathroom was not that clean and did find some hair on the bed -.- Other than that no complains. ",0
Anthony's place was great! Awesome balcony with a beautiful view. Bed was clean and comfortable and the family was very gracious. Convenience to train station was much appreciated. ,1
We just spent one night in this room. The communication with Anthony was very good. There is park space outside and easy to arrive. It is located in a neighboorhood with Vietnam population. Someone from Anthony's family was at home when we arrived. She didn't talk English but she showed us what we needed. It was an usual room next to a main road (a bit noisy but we slept anyway) with TV and heating.,1
"this was falsely advertised, and arguably the worst place i have ever stay. ever. 

pictures are not accurate. 

the kitchen is so disgusting that the only thing we, very cautiously, used was the toaster.
the disgusting kitchen causes the entire apartment to smell bad.

bedroom is 'clean enough'.

did not meet anthony, but he seemed nice via text, email, etc.",0
"The trip went smoothly and Anthony was very communicative and accommodating. The bedroom is in a walk-up apartment- very conveniently located by the train station (red line). Great location if you are visiting colleges in Cambridge because the Red line takes you strait to Harvard Sq and MIT. Even if you bring a car you would save so much time and money taking the train (parking in Boston/Cambridge is a nightmare). 

The bedroom is nice and clean!  The bed is comfortable for two. There is also a space heater in case it gets cold. And the TV was a pleasant surprise! We brought an extra blanket and pillow and it was definitely a good idea! Also consider bringing your own house slippers because the owners do not allow shoes inside. 

Overall I would recommend staying here for a night or two if you are swinging through Boston. ",1
"It was what I expected. Really a very clean place. Although it is located right in front an avenue, the traffic noises were not disturbing. I recommend it. ",1
"The room is clean and big, location is really good. But the air in the room is not that fresh because the windows are sealed. Also you would be living on 2nd or 3rd floor, we have very heavy luggages and that's a pain. Anthony is very nice though. ",0
"The experience here is really great. Real close to the train and the little town. It would be totally fine if you return not too late. Water is hot, rome is big enough for two. Windows are big, and not noisy though so close to the train. After all pretty great, wish I came earlier.",1
"Positive: Private room, very clean, located 2 mins walking distance from the t-station (12 mins with the train to downtown). Also the bathroom was nice and clean. Anthony is a polite and friendly host. We could check in right at 2pm (earliest possible check in time). There is a TV and a fridge in the room.

Negative: The room was cold when we arrived until we found out how to turn on the heating. To have it warm at night, you have to leave the heating on which means that the light emitted by the heating will also be on. On the second day, the bathroom floor was completely wet. It's not possible to open the windows for fresh air because there is plastic between the windows and the shades on the inside.",0
"The house is very close to the subway station, and Anthony is very patient and helpful in solving the problem. Also, the bed is very comfortable :)",1
"The place was clean and as pictured. Very convenient location, minutes from the train. Response to anything asked was very quick although we never saw Anthony.",1
It was really cold outside when I was in Boston. And Anthony's place don't have central heating but there is one radiator working in the room. The windows were sealed by plastic film but you can still feel a little wind blowing in. I thought it would be cold that night but I didn't feel anything after falling into sleep. Maybe it is because I was too tired. The house is just one minute walking to metro station. Really convenient. It is not a bad experience anyway. ,0
"First of all, Anthony and his family was nice and friendly and tried to make our stay most comfortable as possible under the rooming conditions. However, the room was incredible cold, the windows were covered with kind of plastic wrap to keep the wind and cold away but it did not work out at all. The room faces the highway and it was horrible noisy as well during the day as well as in the night! It was very difficult to fall aslepp as a matter of fact.",0
"The location is very convenient which only takes 2 mins to red line subway on foot, and red line can bring you to many attractions. 
The bedroom is spacious and clean, but the bathroom is acceptable because it's public use. By the way, the door lock is broken which we spent much time managing to open the door. Hope the host can improve it :)",0
"first of all, I have to say thank you so much for the bedroom. the location is great, which just took us 2 minutes to go to the red line subway station. And the neighborhood is very kind.

However, I have to say, the bedroom is so cold that we can't sleep well at night. During the time in Boston, it snows, but the center heater doesn't work, even we opened the electric heater, it still feels cold inside. SO I think Anthony should repair the heater system, no one wants to get cold during their trip, all right?

all in all, the bedroom is good and it worth the price. Thank you Anthony!",0
"I have used airbnb for almost 3 years, either by my own account or my sister's account, and I have to say this was my worst experience ever. I honestly never want to write anything negative when leaving comments, reviews, but last night was just too much for me. The biggest problem was the heater. It was ok during the 1st night, just a little bit loud. But on the 2nd night, it started to make very loud and weird noises periodically, about 1-2 times per hour, for the whole night. When I left the place, it was still making loud noises and all that completely ruined my night. I almost could not sleep the whole night, it was like a long nightmare, and the next day was a long day for me. I messaged host, he replied instantly but there wasnt anything that he could have done. I dont know if it has happened to anyone before, or I was just unlucky, but that was really the worst night ever I had using airbnb.This was a horrible experience. 
In addition, the bed was really bad. It kept collapsing very frequently although I was really gentle, and I had to keep fixing it. I cant even turn myself normally during night because it may collapse again. It was a really bad bed.
Again, I never want to post a negative comment, but this was just too much for me. I guess the only cons is that parking is easily available, and maybe a relatively low price. But still, I think for that price I can get a better place where I can at least sleep peacefully at night.
Lastly, Anthony was easy to contact with, he replied me instantly.",0
"Nice neighborhood, quiet as far as foot traffic and immediate road traffic goes. Free parking on street, but that can get filled up at the wrong time of day. Unfortunately, the house is situated directly next to I-93, so lights and highway noise 24/7. Never met the host, don't know if he even lives here. Did meet other guests, plus someone who I think lived there? Not sure, as we were unable to communicate in English. Everyone I met was very nice. House rules didn't indicate whether it was okay to use kitchen to make hot water for tea in the morning. Had continual trouble with lock on door room. First lock was changed out, second lock also stuck. Easy foot access to open space on beach, but walking to UMass campus is not as convenient, involving a larger detour to foot bridge across major road. Easy MBTA access - the station is right on the other side of the highway.",1
It is a good place to stay.,1
 An amazing host we had a great time thank you for everything:),1
The stay was comfortable. The rooms was as described. The location was very convenient and close to downtown and the train stations. Great for a quick stop in Boston. ,1
"Great location and clean room.. there is a bar and breakfast nearby!But near the metro and the road which is t(PHONE NUMBER HIDDEN) noise ,and the radiator occasionally with a loud hissing noise... ",0
Very convenient to the T. Room is spacious and very clean. Perfect for two people. ,1
"Didn't get to meet Anthony on our stay but still nice place. We had a good time in Boston. The train station is very close, about a 1 minute walk. The location is great. ",1
"The room is quite good and Anthony was very attentious. I would like to stay at his palace again next time I visit Boston! 

Thanks for all Anthony!",1
"Found house easily; clear instructions to room.  No frills experience, comfortable bed, accommodating housemates provided towel and hot water for coffee in the morning.  Good experience, thank you, Anthony.",1
"Anthony is very accommodating. He is very reliable by text, he is flexible for check-in time and lets you keep to yourself and go about your travels. The apartment looks just like his pictures, it is just across the street from the subway line, and it's 20 minutes to get into the city center (by the main train station and theater district). It's 40 minutes to BU, or Cambridge area. It's very easy to get around, and there are some restaurants/bars around if you don't feel like going back into the city. There is a bar called dBar that is said to have a good brunch, and McKenna's was packed. A heads up for early birds, there isn't much that is open before 11am for brunch on the weekends. Also, if you're into Vietnamese food, there are plenty of supermarkets with hot food & pho. (But these are mostly  cafeteria style, asian bento box style set ups, not sit down restaurants.) Thanks Anthony, you were a great host!!",1
It is very convenient to go to the downtown. The only problem is that it is noisy outside at night.,1
Very nice and clean room,1
Room was clean and transportation was convenient. ,1
"Anthony's place was cozy and clean, and exactly as described in the listing. My friend and I loved that the train station was such a short walk away - it made getting to downtown Boston such a breeze. 
I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone who needs a comfy place to stay in Boston.",1
Anthony has well met all my needs for the house and amenities during my stay. The room was cozy. He's also very accessible in terms of communication. Metro transportation nearby his bnb house is so convenient that it well covers the small drawback in terms of location.,1
A nice convenient place to stay. Only 2 minutes walk from the red line station.,1
It was very close to the metro station which made exploring Boston very easy. Good communication from Anthony with easy access to room. We enjoyed our stay!,1
"The room is comfortable, big kitchen, and close to subway.",1
Very clean. Easy to find. Perfect lacation.,1
Anthony was an excellent host. We had to add an extra day to our trip and he was able to accommodate us without any hassle. Clean apartment with plenty of amenities. Will definitely consider booking again the next time we're in Boston! ,1
Good,1
"We did not have the opportunity to meet Anthony in person but he made sure to provide us with all the information we needed to get to his apartment. He was also available by phone during the whole time of our stay.
The location of his place is ideal as it is located at less than 5 minutes walking distance from the train station. From there you can go everywhere you want in Boston.
The apartment is shared with Anthony's roommates, they are polite and so quiet that you will barely notice they are there.
The bedroom as well as the common areas were perfectly clean.
The bedroom is equipped with a heater that works very well and will keep you warm all night even when the weather is very cold outside.
Our experience was a wonderful one and we would recommend without an hesitation that you stay at Anthony's place!",1
"The place is located really close to the train station. Besides the room was clean and the self-checkin procedure was very convinient. We haven't met the host, but other roomates were very quiet. However, one should take into account that the place is really close to a highway and the windows aren't noiseproof (and cold-) enough.",0
"Fast response. Room is clean.
There is a portable heater in the room, good for low temperature night.
The house is near T station and convenient, but the traffic noisy sound is a con.",1
"Although we didn't meet the host personally, he was always available on the phone or email. The listing description was quite accurate. The neighborhood is near the freeway and the red T, which is convenient. However, the noise from the freeway and trains was quite disturbing. It was hard to sleep the first night even though we had ear plugs on. Overall, we had a good time in Boston. Thank you Anthony!
",1
"Although we never met our host the process was smooth and easy. The only difficulty we had at the beginning was parking since it was on a Monday and there are limitations as to where you can park, but he was quick to respond and let us know we could use the driveway. It's also really close to public transportation! ",1
Soooooo convenient place!Only 1 minutes to subway.All the things you need is been prepared well by host.,1
"Anthony's private room was clean, spacious and really a very convenient one minute walk to the T. We used his place to stay 1 night and travel further via train to NY. We did not meet him, but he helped us out by texting and was fast in his replies. The shower was clean and warm. I talked to his mother or aunt and she was very welcoming.

As it is right next to a freeway, when we did not use the air conditioning, we could hear the constant traffic. Since a family is living there and using the kitchen a lot, I did not feel comfortable to use the kitchen area.

For the low price, it was the perfect place for us to hop through towards NY by train.",1
Great location. Thank you Anthony for being very accommodating!,1
This was a great little spot for me along with two other friends. We found everything very easily and was very pleased to also have AC on such a nice hot day! Although we never met Anthony he was great at communicating about the room and the acomidations that we needed. Great place to stay for a lovely night in Boston!,1
"Perfect set-up, very spacious room and smooth handling.",1
"The room is very clean and good location, Anthony provides all the help you need. Thank you Anthony!",1
"Place was clean and pleasant to stay, (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) were friendly and helpful. Next to subway, only con was continuous noise from nearby traffic, so nothing for light-sleepers.",0
"A nice, clean and convenient place located near by the subway.",1
"Everything was clean, Anthony let us arrive earlier to drop off our bags and was always easy to reach him by phone.
The only con is that the room is next to a highway and it gets really noisy at night. If you are a light sleeper, this place is probably not for you.",1
"Very close to subway(Savin hill). Even you can see the house in subway station and access to downtown in 15 min. No elevator (3rd floor), some noise from nearby highway at night, but clean, cozy room and comfort rbed, fully eqipped, and reasonable price. I couldn't meet Anthony in person, but he was good at arranging the resevation and telling me how to get to the staying from airport. I highly recommend!",1
Easy to communicate with. Family was living next door for extended stay and they were very helpful. Can be a bit scary at night to walk just because it is very quiet. Overall good experience.,1
Very clean and nice place in good location. Easy to find.,1
"Anthony message me on the day we arrived in Boston and gave direction on how to get to his place. We didn't get to meet each other but he's always available whenever I messaged him. The place was clean and near the train station, which was good for transportation access but at the same time, rather noisy from the trains. It was on the 3rd floor and I wished it was mentioned on the listing because we had big luggages, also the bathroom is shared among 2 other rooms. But overall, good value for the money we spent. ",1
"We only stayed one night in our room. It was comfortable and clean, but unfortunatelly hot.",1
This was our first air BnB experience. The location was perfect being so close to the train station and a quiet area. The room looked just like the photo so you're definitely getting what you see. Anthony was very responsive and accommodating. ,1
"Nice private room in clean and welcoming residential area. The subway in one minute in feet is very enjoyable, nevertheless, the expressway below the house remains unpleasant, in particular the night.",1
"Anthony responded to all my communication very promptly, and he accommodated our need to park and drop off bags before check-in time.  The room was exactly as pictured (plus an A/C unit!), and the location was ideal for hopping on the T to get into the city in about 15-20 minutes.  At night, the road sounds were a bit loud, so I recommend guests bring ear plugs.  Overall, a great value for a quick trip to Boston!",1
Nice home. Comfortable bed.,1
"Anthony responded to all my communications very promptly, usually within one-two minutes. The room looked just like the photo and it was comfortable, spacious and clean. The free street parking without time limit was very convenient. Anthony also mentioned that we can use his driveway to park if we could not find a parking space. However, I wish it was mentioned on the listing that we are sharing the bathroom with the other two rooms, including a family. When I first stepped into the bathroom, I was surprised there was a washing machine standing in the middle of the bathroom and someone was using it. But overall, reasonable and fair price in Boston area. Thank you, Anthony!",0
"It is a really convenience house. The host is very nice. We check in a little bit late and I miss the instruction Email, so I sent messages to the host and ask how to get in the house.He call back very soon and teach me with patience. Nice experience!",1
"The room is sunny and there is a separate fridge. As a whole, this one is larger and better than the other one in the apartment. However, it's a little bit noisy. Washing machine and fridge in the kitchen cannot be used and there is not very much communication between host and me. The host didn't answer some of the questions I asked, which makes me a little bit disappointed. Also, breakfast is not provided as the description. Anyway, it's close to subway station.",0
great place! really convenient ,1
"I didn't have chance to meet Anthony, but could feel that he's a good host and the room's clean and nice to stay for 2 persons. But there's only one shared bathroom. I'm satisfied with overall.",1
Anthony is super kind. He helped us store our luggages and the room is super clean. Very convenient place to the downtown Boston! Worth the value! Will recommend it to my friend!,1
"felt very welcome, and enjoyed to privacy.",1
Sami is really a pleasant host. He took us at the last minute and welcomed us like family. I would recommend anyone to pay him a visit. ,1
Our time with Sami was short but sweet. The accommodation was comfortable and in a great location and Sami was a very hospitable host. We arrived late but he was very understanding of the fact that we wanted to stay out for drinks in the local town. I would recommend  to anyone who wants to explore Boston.,1
Sami is a great host. We had a great conversation with him. The room is also fine in a descent area.,1
"Sami is nice and helpful but I think he is a little severe.Because we have paid for this room and service fee.If he have something dissatisfied,he can tell us in a euphemistic way.That will not make us feel embarrassed.But we still be thankful for what he have done for us.And his kid is very cute.",0
Great host with really clean room.,1
"This was my first experience with Airbnb, and i was greater than i expect. Sami is a great host, the place is very comfy and safe. It was very easy to go downtown aprox. 20 minutes. The neighbourhood is so calm and peaceful.  If i come back to Boston, and i will definitely come. i will stay at his place.",1
"Sami was terrific, warm and welcoming host. He was very helpful and kind. The apartment was extremely clean and neat. My room was great, so it was a kitchen and a (URL HIDDEN)   is nice and quiet and public transportation is fast and easy to use to reach Boston downtown.
I would stay again with Sami if ever need to come back to Boston. I recommend it wholeheartedly!",1
"We had a great time with Sami. He was a excellent host. Before we finished booking, he asked us wanna book it or not cuz someone was inquiring too. This action was so sweet or we would lost chance staying with a such nice host. He dropped off us to home when we were arrival and gave us a ride to subway when we were gone. That made us more easier because we had heavy luggages. We had a good conversation with him too. He was nice to talk. Besides, his son and his cat were so cute. And location was good as well. It was easy to reach to downtown Boston. I do recommend staying with Sami. ",1
Sam is very hospitable and helpful and his house has a nice location from which it is easy to get to downtown Boston. The room is clean and tidy with all necessities. I strongly recommend those who want to visit Boston to stay here.,1
"Sami is one of the most nicest person l ever met.He is a kind and carefully host,he even cooked us something when we got in his house.The room is exactly as in pics,everything is very clean and it's a very good place to stay if you want to visit the city.I really recommend this cozy place.",1
"Nice clean room, exactly as described. Sami is a really friendly guy who took care of everything. Would definitely recommend to this to anyone staying in Boston.",1
"Great place to stay in Boston! Sami and his son are awesome. Felt at home instantly. His place is next to the train station that goes straight downtown.
I recommend his place... you will not regret it when you book it!",1
"It was pleasant, clean, host was very nice, good location, excellent value, ",1
"Sami was a great Host. Eventhough we couldn't spend a lot of time together. I like him. He is very friendly. You can talk about music, street art and culture. I would want to stay in his place again. ",1
"Sami is very nice and recommended us of some foods around.
It is really comfortable to stay for a night.",1
"A very nice host! Clean place, actually not that far from downtown Boston! 
Sami is a really nice guy! I would strongly recommand this housing to anyone!",1
Sami's girlfriend was very nice and room was cozy.,1
Sami is a very hospitable. He is very nice towards his guests. He welcomed us and explained us all the facilities and the rules clearly. I liked the bedroom and the bathroom was very clean with fresh towels. I would strongly recommend everyone to stay here. ,1
"Sami was such a good and friendly host. His house was very comfortable, clean and his kitchen is equipped with a lot utensils which made it easy for us to prepare on-the-go meals. Definitely recommend.",1
"I had to cancel at the last-minute -- snowstorm, so I couldn't drive up to Boston.  Thus, I can't speak about Sami's home -- I haven't seen it yet.  But Sami was very, very easy and pleasant to deal with in the planning stage, and I'm looking forward to staying at his place on a future visit.",1
"Very cosy and comfortable -- very quiet -- very clean.  Sami was very hospitable, friendly, flexible, and easy to work with.  I would stay here again very happily.",1
"We had a wonderful time staying at Sami's place. The room was cozy and just as shown in the pictures. His house is really comfortable with -most important- a well equiped kitchen and a clean and nice barhroom. We had the opportunity of sharing with him, his son and his cat! That was really awesome because it felt like home. 
The neighborhood is quite and safe so you can relax while in there. You also have many places to go for dinner or just a drink. It's really close to the bus stops and the train station. 
We can only be thankful with Sami for all his help during our trip.",1
"Sami's place was comfortable, clean, and conveniently located. At the moment I arrived , I felt welcomed right into the household. Sami went above and beyond to make me feel like an old friend over for a weekend visit. ",1
"I never expected that my first stay with Airbnb would be so AMAZING! Sami is such a nice host - very helpful, understanding and easy to get along with. He could be very talkative if the guests want to have a chat and he very much respects the guests' privacy if the guests choose to stay in their room instead. His place is very clean and artistic. Public transportation is 3 minutes' walk away and there are very good restaurants nearby. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND his place!",1
"My second time staying at Sami's cosy place.  It's perfect for me -- very comfortable -- very quiet -- very clean -- has everything I need -- Sami is very welcoming, helpful, kind, and easy-to-work with.  ",1
"Sami made it very easy to stay at his house, and he greeted me and my brother just as we had worked out in our communication  :) Everything was very clean and comfortable and it felt cheerful too! It was also very easy to park on the street right in front of his place. I would recommend this spot & I hope to return here next time I need a place to stay in Boston!",1
"Another excellent Airbnb experience! Sami and his son Joshua were truly the fantastic host, and I cannot thank them too much for having my wife and me at their pretty house. Even before we took off to Boston, the communication was prompt, accurate and informative which made us really comfortable interacting our upcoming host. And, sure enough, they are one of the most generous and modest persons you could imagine. Since I had a training/conference opportunity near Boston, my wife and I decided to arrive a few days in advance and enjoy spending a weekend like locals – not just staying at drabby hotel room. And, as soon as we stepped into Sami’s house, we felt like this is our home away from home. The house was absolutely spotless, really cozy and quiet, yet welcoming atmosphere where everybody would relax and spend some quality time. Besides, there was an excellent public transportation system that allows you to get you in and out from downtown Boston easily. Naturally, as you walk into someone else’s house, we do need to respect our host as well as neighbors. Yet, as far as you have a common sense to stay just like you were invited to your friend’s house, your experience would be just wonderful. We are looking forward to have another stay at Sami’s place in the future. Thank you very much once again for having us to your lovely house. ",1
"Sami and his son are fun, full of life and awesome artists! We very much appreciated the cozy accommodations and great vibes! I highly suggest staying with them and will be staying with them again when I come back! ",1
Sami was a wonderful host! He made sure we were comfortable and was able to help us work around our weird schedule! Would highly recommend the accommodation.,1
Sami is very sympathetic. This first stop in our trip is the first good souvenir from our holidays in the USA. The bed and accommodations are very good.  I recommend this home to stay. ,1
"Nice and cozy place, Sami was very courteous and helpful... Looking forward to stop by in a near future. ",1
"Samy and his son Joshua were really friendly and welcoming. We had a wonderfull time, their house is really clean, and lovely. The area is safe and easy with public transport.
Samy is open minded and we had really nice chat!
It's definitely a good address to keep!!",1
"Clean and quiet room! The apartment is easy to access with public transportation, also during night and at the weekend. Great and very responsive host, what makes the communication easy and the stay comfortable. ",1
"Sami was an amazing host! He provided direction to his house ever since the start and continued to being an amazing host until the end. He is overall very supportive and Chester, his cat is very cute. The bathroom is clean and has it all. The bedroom is neat and clean as well. My friend and I truly enjoyed our stay at Sami's. :-)",1
"Great Host! Sami was very welcoming. Our stay there was short, but still had fun. The neighborhood was quiet and calm. I would definitely go back again! ",1
"Sami and his son are very kind people. We felt welcomed and enjoyed our stay comfortably. The bedroom is just like in the pictures and, like the bathroom, was very clean. Also, the neighborhood is excellent. Would definitely stay there again.",1
"My friend and I had a long layover (16h) in boston, and wanted a place to shower/nap. We contacted Sami and asked if we could use his place during the day, checking in at 9am and checking out in the evening. Sami was very accommodating, and said that would be no problem. He always responded to our messages within minutes, and gave us his cell phone number before our stay just in case we had any trouble finding the place.

The house is in a good location. Quiet neiborhood, easy to get to by public transit, and within walking distance of the Arnold Arboretum. The room and bathroom are clean, and served our purpose of showering and napping perfectly. We were very happy that we found Sami and his place!",1
"Sami and his apartment were wonderful. The room was comfortable, the bathroom was super clean, and the communication/coordination with Sami was easy and stress-free. I would certainly recommend, and I will personally try to stay here again!",1
"When we first arrived we had run into some terrible traffic that had set our arrival time much later into the night than we had originally planned. Sami was very understanding and kind when we finally did arrive. The apartment is very clean and neat and easy to find. The room itself is slightly small and may not be the best option for travelers with a lot of luggage. Since we were traveling for over a month we had two people and four pieces of luggage so the room size was a bit too small but would do well for short stays and less luggage. The beds themselves are bunk beds and are not the most comfortable but will do for a short visit. We enjoyed our stay, the only part that was a bit difficult was the rule of no showers past 10. Understandably Sami's son stayed and went to sleep earlier however, when traveling in a new city it is often difficult to gage how long things will take and we found ourselves rushing back to try to take a shower before 10. All in all I would recommend for a short stay. ",0
"Sami and his son, Joshua, were really nice and welcoming during our 3 nights of stay. Sami was very understanding and helpful. He gave us a ride one day on his way out, and was very accommodating overall. 
The location is relatively easy with public transportation (one bus to the closest subway station). I would definitely recommend this location to stay.  
",1
"Only stayed for one night, but was everything we needed. Great host. Would recommend. ",1
"We arrived in Boston on a Friday afternoon somewhat unfamiliar to the territory. I contacted Sami as soon as we were off the train and he helped us navigate the subway system to his place. It's less than a $7 Uber ride from the last stop on the Orange Line to Sami's place, and he even offered to come pick us up! Once we arrived at his place, he was extremely welcoming, we spoke about his vinyl collection and how excited we were to see the Red Sox play. When we left the next day, Sami waited with us while we waited for our Uber and we had a very pleasant conversation. Sami is a wonderful host, and if I ever visit Boston in the near future, he will be the first one I call. ",1
The house really looks the same as the pictures and every room has different color (URL HIDDEN) really clean.Sami is really helpful and he pick us up at the subway station as we first arrived.And the neighborhood is nice.Near the neighborhood is a nice area with lovely restaurant and supermarket.,1
Our stay was pleasant and the location was about 25 minutes from the city. Sami was a great host and made us feel safe and comfortable. I would stay again! ,1
"Sami was really nice and the room was comfortable to stay. Also, the location was not so far from downtown and good place. Thank you Sami.",1
It was a nice stay,1
"What can I say Sami was a remarkable host. My son and I has traveled to Boston to watch a game with out any reservations. Just because I didn't have an idea of what to do after. I had contacted Sami after the game and he opened his home to us. Sami is a very nice and pleasant host, my son loved his cat. It was nice to talk to him and get to know him a little on a personal basis. 
Now as for the room, it was perfect for us. We slept on a bunk bed. The room can be small if you have a lot of luggage and bed small if your tall. You be about 20 min from the ball park and 30 from bus station. I uber to get around and it was easy and affordable. I recommend Sami place to others looking to visit Boston he is reasonable on all aspects. ",1
It was really great and Sami was a very warm and helpful host. ,1
"Had a wonderful time staying with Sami in Boston. Was very clean, quiet and easy to find. Sami was also very nice, and very helpful with directions.  Overall a great AirBnb stay, that was just a short subway ride from downtown. Would gladly stay with him again!",1
"Sami was an extremely welcoming host! His place is very clean and organized. He provided us with towels and allowed us to use his Kureig! Bunk beds were comphy. 

He is located a little outside the city, so we used Uber most of the trip. There is a nice bike path that is fairly easy to get to from his place that will take you near the MFA without using much public road.",1
Sami is a great host. The location was just what we needed for a few days to access downtown south Boston. ,1
"Sami is a great host. His house is very clean and big I like it. We felt very comfortable living in his house. If you come to visit Boston, Sami's house is the best choice.",1
Loved the general experience for a night's stay. ,1
"We only saw Sami once, he seemed very nice. The description of the room was very accurate, and the place was easy to find",1
"Generally good. However, I don't think Sami meets the criteria of a super host. When we asked him if we could do laundry, he said that he did not do laundry. Nevertheless, he used washer and dryer quiet often. It's not a problem if he just says ""sorry, but this service is not provided."" I would honestly say that other super hosts I met are better.

",0
"Extraordinary experience!! Sami is totally a super host. He was always available by (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), and he even wait for us to arrive. He even accept my reservation a day after my arrival (that was a life saver). The room is exactly like the photos and it's very clean. The area is very nice and secure, which is very near to a bus station and the subway!!! But if you have car, you can park it on the street. Thank you very much Sami! It was a fabulous experience being with you!",1
Sami is a good host and he made us comfortable as home. The room is more warm and cozy than on the pictures. The place is about 5-10 mins far from the station and it's easy to find. Chester the cat is so friendly just like Sami! ,1
This is a nice location for Boston and only a few minutes’ walk to restaurants nearby. Sami is a great host and his place is comfortable. The location is great and it only took about 20 minutes or so to drive downtown.,1
"We arrived very late in the middle of the night and found the apt to be clean and nicely air conditioned. There were extra linens and towels to accommodate all three of us.  The bed was comfy but the sofa bed wasn't unfortunately.  It was better for my friend to sleep directly on the sofa.

It can be noisy from street traffic even though we were on the top floor.  But that didn't really bother us.  

The unit is quite small for 3 adults but if it's just one or a couple, then there's enough room.  We appreciated that the condo was modern and minimally decorated.

It's pretty conveniently located and street parking on the block over the weekend was easy considering we were not residents and most neighborhoods require resident permits.  We also rented bikes that we rode around the city.  There is a bike rental area a block away, on the same block as an awesome coffee shop called Render Coffee.  ",1
"Tidy, comfortable apartment. Smaller than it looks in the pictures, but still a nice size for one person. Enjoyable stay!",1
"We had a great stay here.  The location was ideal, so close to the Mass Ave. orange line, and easy walking distance to all the action in Back Bay and beyond.  We arrived early in the morning on a redeye from the West Coast, and Will was very accommodating, letting us check in early.  It was a bit small for a couple with two teenagers, but it met our needs just fine as we really weren't spending that much time in the apartment anyway.  We liked it much better than staying in a hotel--it's great to get up in the morning to your own coffee and breakfast, and occasionally eat dinner in as well.  Easy walking distance to grocery stores and restaurants--Estelle's and Parish Cafe just downstairs were great!  The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 was the nighttime noise level, which wasn't a surprise given the other reviews.  We would definitely stay here again, just remember to bring ear plugs.",1
"This apartment was PERFECT for us! We stayed a week while we moved our daughter to Boston -- It's in a great location, very convenient to the Green Line or Orange Line T, walking distance to the Whole Foods, plenty of nearby restaurants.  Our daughter used the inflatable mattress for a couple of nights until her apartment was ready--that was a little cramped, but doable. Although the building is old, the apartment has been redone, with everything in it new; very clean, good A/C circulation, extra linens/towels. Yes, because of it's location, it is a little noisy at night (restaurants/bars/busy city scene), but no more so than any other big city location I've stayed in. This was my first Airbnb experience, and it could not have been better. Thank you, Will! We look forward to coming back! (PS: If I had been traveling alone, I probably couldn't have gotten my very large suitcase up the stairs by myself...next time I will travel lighter to navigate the stairs.)",1
"It was a great place in a great location.  The only two downsides are that we stayed on the 4th floor so there was a lot of walking up and down with no elevator, and the traffic could get a bit loud, but you're in the heart of Boston so that can't be helped.  My girlfriend and I had a great time and enjoyed staying there.  Would definitely stay there again if we are ever in Boston",1
"This apartment worked well for us. We were attending a conference, so the location was ideal, and it was clean, with everything (WiFi, appliances) working. The place is small, but for a couple, or two friends who don't mind the living room being taken up with the folded down sofa bed, it's fine. Would definitely recommend it. Will supplied us with all the necessary information, so check in and check out were simple processes. ",1
"Overall a very good experience: very clean, well equipped apartment; comfortable bed; good shower; new, modern appliances; washer and dryer in basement. Availability of items like hairdryer and coffee machine was a plus (would have been nice if coffee was provided too). 
Location is quite good for South End, close to Mass. Avenue on the orange T line and with the silver line bus to downtown and South Station on the corner of Mass. Avenue and Washington Street also close by. Some good restaurants nearby (tried Orinoco and El Centro, both on Shawmut Ave.)
The whole building is made up of apartments rented out in this way, and access is by code, which makes things convenient as there's no need to arrange a meetup with the owner. 
Only major warning: be aware that Tremont is a busy street and the traffic noise is really quite loud in the apartment even overnight, so if you're a light sleeper ear plugs are recommended.",1
"Booked at really short notice but everything was easy and smooth.
The apartment looks exactly as in the pictures and is clean and tidy, I was visiting alone but it'd be a perfect size for 2.
Wifi was a bit patchy at times and slow but great when it worked. 
Would've been nice to have some basic supplies like tea and coffee but I understand why some people don't leave them in a kitchen. 
Would definitely return and recommend. ",1
"The apartment was very comfortable and the location worked out well, as we were needing to be near North Eastern University. Beware the walkup, it's long! ",1
Overall experience was great! Location and apartment are fantastic and Will was very responsive. ,1
"Very nice apartment, and the immediate neighborhood is very nice as well.  Loved the keyless entry, everything is opened by keypads on the doors, very convenient.  Will was available when I called him on my way into town to make sure I was all set up.  

The set up of the apt could use some work.  If the TV and the couch were swapped it would flow a lot better, as the couch being on that side of the room really closes off the living room.  For the first two days I was kicking the couch or the table every time I entered the room.  Since I didn't use the TV anyway, I actually moved the couch to the other side of the room where it fit nicely into a nook and it really opened it up!  Counter/cabinet space is also an issue, if you are staying longer term, don't plan on buying groceries that go into the cabinets.  

Make sure you keep your head about you, as a few blocks over it does get kinda dicey.  I never had an issue, but spoke with many people locally who all said ""don't go that way.""  I will restate, I did not have an issue with safety, but thought it was worth noting.  

Location is convenient, walking up Tremont is great for restaurants, Estelle's and  Parish are both right down stairs and have great beer selections, as well as a great staff.  Mass Ave is also a nice walk to get down to Newbury St. or the Copley area.  I was here for two and a half weeks and it was ideal for me (besides the cabinet space).  I'd definitely stay here again!  ",1
"We had a lovely stay in this apartment.  South End is a great location as you can walk to lots of central areas including Copley Square and the main shopping streets. Or the T line stop is just down the road, plus there are buses to Cambridge that go from right outside (the number 1).  There are loads of nice places to eat and we fell in love with the Flour bakery.

Will was very helpful in advance of our visit, and provided a travel cot (pack and play) for our little boy to use.

The apartment itself had everything we needed, with a nice well equipped kitchen that meant we could cook a few simple meals with no hassle.  The rooms are all a good size and there's a nice view of the Piano Factory over breakfast.

The apartment is on quite a busy junction, with a gas station right opposite, so it is quite noisy and also bright at night.  We found it OK with the windows closed (there is air conditioning) but we were on the top floor - I think the lower floors are probably really quite noisy.  Saying that, we didn't hear a peep out of any other neighbours so it was quiet inside the building!

We used the laundry room which was really useful and easy.

Thanks Will!  We've recommended your place to our Boston-based friends to suggest to other visitors in the future!",1
"I didn't meet anyone at the apartment as the apartment is unlocked using a code sent by a property management company via email. The apartment is a lot smaller than it looks in the pictures, however is clean and tidy. The location isn't the best in Boston and not as close to downtown as I thought. The neighborhood is up and coming and still has some desirable characters around. The noise was a little excessive as its on a main road and close to a building being renovated next door.",0
In a class of its own. Great place. Very modern apartment.  Close to everything. In walking distance of town-center.  We recommend this place to others,1
"Small but nice apartment. Check-in went very easy (I was e-mailed the access codes a couple of days before our arrival) and we were allowed to leave our luggage in the building after check-out, which was a big plus. Close to public transport (bus stops across the street and two metro lines are a 5-minute walk). Bars/restaurants downstairs and a lot more up Tremont street (10-minute walk). Only big downside: the noise. The apartment is on a big intersection and it appears that nothing is done to cancel out the noise from outside. I was able to fall asleep with earplugs and the traffic noise dies down late at night but we weren't able to sleep later than 7AM due to traffic and construction noise. It didn't ruin our stay but I wouldn't have chosen the apartment if I had known.",0
Great apartment. Everything was kept in excellent form. Superb location. Easy access. Couldnt have asked anything more from a host.,1
"What a cute a comfortable place. I rented this cozy modern apartment for my father and daughter for an event I was hosting. So I myself cannot comment on the comfort of the beds, but the feedback from them was all great and they really loved the place and its wonderful location. I will definitly recommend this place again for out of town guests.   ",1
Well situated and very clean but quite expensive and no double windows.,0
"The place was great!  The apartment was exactly as displayed on the site.  The owner provided fresh sheets, pillows, towels, an iron, a hair dryer and a coffee maker.  Also, he left us a notebook of all the various things to do in the neighborhood and their proximity to the apartment.  The neighborhood was great, but the apartment is on a busy street.  It could be troublesome for light sleepers.  However, it was close to a ton of nice restaurants, coffee shops and parks.  We were abIe to rent bicycles around the corner from the house and tour the city.  That was awesome!  Boston is a great city to tour by bike.  It's flat and easy to get around.  All in all this was a great apartment and would recommend this to anyone.",1
"Nice and clean appartment! For four people a bit too small but we still felt very comfortable.
The access codes were sent via email a few days before which made it very convenient on the day of arrival.",1
"Great location, communication, and overall experience. ",1
Great place to stay - easy check-in and check-out. The apartment was in excellent shape and very clean. Thanks for making things so easy! ,1
"I througly enjoyed my stay in Boston last week. The apartment was in a brilliant location just a five minute walk from the T stop which was great. 
Inside it was clean and neat and a list was given of good places for breakfast, lunch etc was provided. 
I would highly recommend staying here and it was excellent value for money :) ",1
"Great Great Great location/neighborhood.  Perfect for visitors to NOrtheastern or Berklee since location is within a short walk.  Apartment was clean and modern.  Fits 2-3 comfortably.  
Had a great weekend.
",1
"My first airbnb experience.   This is a small apartment building, very central and convenient, tastefully remodeled, and at a very fair rate.  Easy walking distance to the Common, Freedom Trail, Fenway Park and more.  Excellent laundry machines in the basement, which was an unexpected plus.  Well-equipped kitchen ... except for the lack of a fullsize frypan.  No contact with the host, but this was not a problem.
On the  downside: This place works only for a couple.  The sofabed is not usable.  We were three people - grampa, dad and 8-yr-old son. so Grampa slept on the floor.   Should not be rented to any more than two people.
The stairs are steep and narrow.  Worked ok for a 67-year-old grampa, but be prepared for a climb.
Overall a positive first airbnb experience.  Thanks. ",0
everything was great. Apartment was decent and its location was close to everywhere... ,1
"We were pleased to see that the apartment fitted the online photos and description. Although there was four of us (adults) we  had enough space. It was very clean and bright inside, apartment and house in very good condition there even was a walk in closet for the luggage. Easy access via code made the arrival and departure an easy act. 
The only problem we met upon arrival was a lack of towels and difficulty with air mattresse, which both were fixed the very same day. Our apartment was on 3rd level which was a good and appreciated exercise for us but perhaps not for those with reduced mobility.  Neighborhood is great and we felt safe. A nearby Hubway station made it easy for us to cycle to nearest attractions, shops and restaurants. 
Highly recommend!",0
"A very modern, bright, and airy flat. It was really well equipped and had everything we needed to make it a 'home' to go back to after exploring Boston. The entry code system made checking in so simple and meant you didn't have to remember a key. A great location as it's close to the T station making it convenient to get around Boston. Quite a few places to eat nearby though my favourite has got to be Giacomo's. Massive portions of amazing pasta. Two of the six nights we stayed there were loud 'pops' outside around 2am which sounded like gun shots but coming back after dark and walking around during the day felt absolutely safe and I'd never have believed it could happen in the area. I'm half hoping for an alternative explanation or that I imagined it! Regardless I'd definitely stay there again if I was coming back to Boston. Thanks for a brilliant stay. ",1
The apartment was perfect! Super clean with everything we could want or need! Wifi and TV worked with no problems! The location was ideal- easy access to great South End restaurants and a short walk to Back Bay or Fenway! I would definitely recommend this place for a stay in Boston! ,1
"The apartment was very welcoming! Easy to find, easy to get in and the neighborhood is a great location! The posting is very accurate! It fits 4 if you want 2 to the bed in the bedroom and 2 on the pull out couch. It's a little tight, but just enough space to go back to at the end of the day to sleep. My only complaint is that we only had 3 bath towels for the 4 of us. And only one kitchen towel, but we made it work. Other reviews were on spot with the noise, so be sure to bring earplugs. Thanks for a wonderful and easy stay!",1
"The booking process and follow through could not have been smoother.  Booking confirmation within hours of inquiry and contract followed close behind.  A few days before our scheduled arrival, we received the digital entry codes into the building and specific unit along with local contact info if we needed anything and WI-FI passwords.  The unit was clean and had everything we needed for our 3 day stay.  Very minor things, a few burned out light bulbs here and there did not impact our stay.  The building has been renovated, but there are a few things you should make note of -- this building is located at a busy intersection within a true urban area, so there is outside noise.  The area felt safe.  We walked through the surrounding neighborhood during both the daytime and evening.  A number of restaurants and other business nearby.  We also visited the Museum of Fine Arts which is an easy walk, which we greatly enjoyed.  Whole foods and smaller convenience stores are within easy walking distance.  The pictures provided are an accurate portrayal of the apartment . . . it's small, but good light and perfect for a couple.  Another couple mentioned their review they shared the unit with another couple -- obviously doable, but a little too cozy in my opinion.  If we were headed back to Boston and needed lodging in the South End, I would most certainly rent here again. ",0
"yes we felt welcome, liked the codes to get into the doors instead of keys, described just like it was

we enjoyed our stay, we would stay there again",1
"This South Side apartment is great for walkers - an easy 2-4 blocks to 2 T-lines (subway), a Whole Foods, a Trader Joe's, & CVS. In addition, several hospitals. Situated in a residential neighborhood,  there's a cute jazz club (Wally's) that you MUST go to for Latin Jazz night. The apt is a true-2 person, modern, compact & cozy spot. It's great to come back to after a long day out and rest/sleep. Not much room for visitors or children. The pullout couch has a worn/unusable mattress. The airmattress was an acceptable substitution. Although it is a variable the host may have no control over, the neighborhood gets noisy at night. I would invest in double-pane glass windows as to not deter future reservations. With that exception, I would stay here again.",0
The place was great. Very clean and easy check in and out. Very accessible and walkable to the majority of the city. We loved it.,1
"The apartment was as described, although a little smaller than appears in the pictures (good photography). But there was any and everything you needed in the apartment.  It was clean and in a great location (2 blocks from Mass Ave Orange Line).  Our family had a great experience.  ",1
"The unit was very neat and clean, with clever uses of space, and clear directions for guests.  Location was great for us, as our friends lived nearby and transportation was very accessible. Plus restaurants nearby were fabulous.  It is on a big noisy intersection, and despite reassurances, we had to use earplugs to sleep because of the sirens and car stereo noises. (and we are used to city noise!) But it was quite a comfortable room.  We had no direct contact with the host when we arrived. When we left a request for an air mattress that didn't leak our first night there, they left one in the unit the next day.   The air mattress on the floor worked great as a secondary sleeping area once it arrived.  It is a perfect unit for two people, perhaps three, but four (two adults and two kids) was doable but tight. ",1
"The apartment in Boston was just as described. Easy to find, well located, very clean, and nicely decorated. My mom and I had a great time exploring the city while having the comfort and ease of coming in and out using the secure and private door codes. I would definitely rent with this company again.",1
"Booked with Will for my family's trip to Boston - they're pretty picky and they had no major complaints.  They said everything was great, except the bed was a little saggy.  Overall, great experience - Will's communications were very informative and my family had a great time.  Thanks Will!",1
"Apartment was great - clean, well situated, easy to find. I would definitely stay here again! Only complaint would be that the windows don't block out any noise from the street, so be prepared with some earplugs. ",1
"Will's apartment was exactly as described. Perfect location, just a few blocks from the T. Loved the keyless entry. We did NOT find our apartment to be noisy from traffic, although we were on the 6th floor. I would recommend this apartment to anyone visiting Boston!",1
Everything was as described. The apartment is very clean an good located. We received prompt reply to any question. We had a great time in Boston and can highly recommend the apartment.,1
"The apartment was clean and well equipped but it's a bit far from downtown.
We had some inconveniences but staff was very reactive to our concerns.
The place is not managed by a private individual but by a company, so it's not very ""airbnb spirit"" and it's very impersonal.
Nevertheless, it's a good place to stay.",0
Everything at the Tremont street apartment was as advertised!  Will's space is clean and comfortable.  Four of us stayed and there was plenty of space.  The location was great for all the site seeing we wanted to do.  We enjoyed our time in Boston and would definitely recommend staying here!,1
Great stay,1
"The flat was exactly as described, clean and modern, it was ideal for 2 maximum 3 but not more in our opinion.
It was well furnished and the access was convenient with a code to enter the common space and the apartment itself.
It is well located and you can access all Boston areas from there.
The only limitation from our point of view was the departure. As the flat is not run by will itself but belongs to its business, it is not flexible concerning the storage of luggage, and you can not discuss it with him like we always did with real host in our former stays in AirBnb flats.
But it was overall a pleasant stay",1
"The apartment and location was absolutely perfect. Two blocks to the  Massachusetts subway station and many restaurants, etc. The room was very clean and comfortable. Public areas and restrooms were very modern. I would absolutely recommend this and stay there again.",1
"Will's place was exactly as advertised, very clean, and very nice.  Worked very well for the 4 of us.  You could potentially fit 5 if you had 2 couples and 1 for the couch, but no more than that.  Might be a tough climb to Unit #6 for anyone with mobility issues.",1
"The place was well organized. The whole apartment was a little smaller than what I expected from the pictures. Will was a helpful host. Internet speed was little slow. The apartment was neat and clean. Overall, it was a good experience though the price was high.Thanks.",1
"Very clean and spacious 1 bedroom apt in great, convenient location. Highly recommend. ",1
I stayed here for a month and really enjoyed it. Very nice apartment with great amenities. Everything from the kitchen supplies to the shower and the bed were high quality. Buses and subway nearby. Not to mention tons of amazing south end restaurants. Highly recommended. ,1
"The host made me feel very welcome and the check-in was very easy since the building and apartment have keypad entry. The apartment is very close to the Orange, Green and Silver Lines making getting around Boston simple.  It is also on the #1 bus route which goes directly to MIT and Harvard.  The laundry in the basement was free and easy to use and the Wifi was very fast. The only three cons to the apartment are: (1) that the street it is on is quite noisy because of the traffic; (2) it is located on the third floor which requires climbing two sets of steep stairs; (3) the apartment is very bright with a skylight in the living room and large bedroom windows which can make it hard to sleep in.  But even with these in mind, I would definitely stay there again.  ",0
"Very cozy 1 bedroom type apartment, even the staircase up was lovely. I liked that we had the privacy and basic accommodations of a hotel, but still felt like we were staying with someone living in Boston. ",1
Quality rental. Exactly as pictured. ,1

Very pretty apartment in a great neighborhood. Some terrific architectural features like the bay window. Decorated by someone with a keen eye.
Stairs to apt. are steep, but the upper apts are quieter.
Easy to reach host.",1
Excellent place to stay! Good location. Provided all the essentials needed for our stay. ,1
"I had a very enjoyable stay, all was just as described and perfect for me.  Thanks!",1
"A Nice and safe location. We used the sofa bed for our 12 year old. It is perfect for a three day stay at Boston.  The parking is difficult.  We got lucky for the first two nights and found parking in front of the building.  On the third night, we have to park in a public parking across street which costed 30 dollars a night.  ",1
"Place was as pictured and described.  Great place to stay, no issues.",1
"The room was perfect for our one night stay in Boston. A king size bed and a large pull out sofa was great for four people. The host was super quick in responding and helping us with all of our questions. If you want an affordable and comfortable place to stay, I would definitely recommend! ",1
"Good location, clean place, would recommend. There was some mistake with the dates but Piter sorted it out and paid for an uber ride downtown.",1
The description of the location and premises was accurate ,1
"I stayed at this place for 2 nights with my family(total 4 of us). The description and the pictures were accurate, however a key detail that was missing was that the bathroom that was in the hallway had to be shared with other residents staying next door. In our case 4+3, total of 7 had to share 1 bathroom. Street  parking was free, although was not readily available on the same street. Very often, we had to park 2-3 blocks away. Overall, the experience was ok given the fact it was few miles away from downtown and price was reasonable. Host was very responsive. ",0
"Together with my two friends, I stayed at his nice place. Everything was as described and we would stay with him again. The communication worked excellent. Piter and his wife are cheerful persons and provide many information about Boston.",1
Piter was quick to reply and to set everything before our arrival. He was a great caring host! I definitely recommend it!,1
"Thank you, Peter, It was very nice staying in Boston. I like the city. It was quite convenient area and reasonable. ",1
"This was really a bad place. It was run down, with little other facilities but beds to sleep in. The neighbourhood is not nice. We did not get our instructions how to get the keys before we arrived, and when we arrived, there was nobody there to let us in. We were standing there on the street with our suitcases, trying to reach the host, which we couldn't at first. Finally he sent us a code for the keybox, which he should have done in advance. It was very hard to communicate with him.",0
"We had a fantastic experience. Everything about this place is right:

The hosts: Stacey was super nice and accommodating
The room: nice big room with two beds and A/C
The location: nice neighborhood, close to JFK T station and the ocean; there convenient stores, bars and eateries around

6 stars.
Thank you so much!
",1
"We had fun, the room was cool with the AC, Piter and his wife were there to help us with directions and suggestions.",1
"List description was accurate, host was very friendly and made our stay very comfortable ",1
"We had a bedroom for 3 with one kingsize bed and one sleeping couch. We haven't met Piter personally but communication by writing was fine, he answered very fast. The house is a bit far away from city center, but we used the subway (ten minute walk) to reach it. the room and the bathroom were clean. We shared the bathroom with other roomneighbours (we think also Air bnb
 guests) in the highest floor (it was very warm but the air conditioning was very good!). It was more like a hostel feeling.",1
Exactly as advertised.,1
Boston was great! Loved the food and the weather was amazing. Very very awesome location near everything.....,1
"Everything went well, it is a nice place and i recommend it.",1
"Our stay on Chris and Thierry's yacht was an fantastic experience!  From the minute Thierry collected us and walked us on board to a welcoming Chris, we completely enjoyed our time.  The yacht is beautifully appointed and pristine.  They had welcome snacks and beverages ready for us laid out with the flair of a fine hotel.  They treated us like old friends, chatting and visiting but retreating to allow private time to enjoy the deck and sun.  Our breakfast was ready when we woke, delicious and plentiful.  We can HIGHLY recommend this venue, you will remember this one!!",1
"Terry and Chris are real gentlemans. When I first saw Terry, I immediately like to him. He is so warm kind and considerate.The yacht is very beautiful, although the space is limited, Room layout is reasonable, there are enough place to luggages and activities. Room is nice and warm, bed is very comfortable. More than that, Breakfast of every morning was great and  delicious ! I think this is the best breakfast of our trip in USA! I'm looking forward to and meet them again, in Florida.

Jingyan & Fei",1
"We had a wonderful visit with Terry & Chris. This is a unique and memorable spot, and their hospitality left nothing to be desired. I could go on about how clean the boat is (very) or how close it is to much of what Boston has to offer. But what really made our stay were all of the thoughtful touches that made us feel special - how we were welcomed, the mini floral arrangements, how our cabin was set up and ready for us, coffee and hot breakfast in the morning. An FYI for those who rarely go on the water - even while docked, the boat will have a subtle movement from time to time. I only mention this for those who might be extremely sensitive because it's barely noticeable. No surprise here - we hope to stay with Terry & Chris again.",1
"First Class! Terry and CJ (Chris) were phenomenal hosts to me and my husband during an unforgettable 2 night stay on their yacht.  Booking communication was promot and informative.  Arrival was seamless and gracious as we were greeted by Terry who walked us from our car to the yacht and had  refreshments waiting for us aboard.  We had a wonderful visit with Terry and CJ who provided us with great information about how to best navigate the city, key points of interest within walking distance, and recommendations for dining that proved to be outstanding!   Our cabin was immaculate, as was the entire yacht.  Comfortable bedding and amenties in both the cabin and bath made us feel right at home with a little extra pampering.  We were pleasantly surprised to have a lovely breakfast waiting for us each morning and only wished we had more time to spend with these great guys.  We own and operate 6 vacation rentals and list on this site.  For 3 years we have searched various vacation rental sites for accomadations while embracing the paradigm shift in lodging.  This is the FIRST one we actually booked.  Terry and CJ have set the mark high and we really appreciated being able to enjoy their efforts in making their  home available for us to enjoy.  I would stay in any property they hosted knowing the experience will be outstanding.  ",1
"Terry and CJ were exceptional hosts... They are easy going, generous, and really great guys.",1
"Terry and CJ were amazing hosts and provided everything we needed. We are from Boston but wanted a staycation that was different and this was definitely an amazing experience. Everything was so clean, it was exactly like the pictures showed, and the views were incredible! ",1
Our stay was fantastic. The boat is in the North End with great view from the deck. Loved every minute of our stay. The room was great! Breakfast was even better. Terry and CJ provided a great local experience of Boston.,1
"I was looking for something unique and relaxing to do to surprise my fiance for her birthday and was excited to find Terry & CJ's listing.  The location was fantastic. We spent most of our time on the boat sitting on the sun deck overlooking the park and Boston skyline but also enjoyed the harbor walk and amazing food/drink options just steps from the dock.  Terry was great, he went above and beyond to ensure we had everything we needed and even took us for a harbor cruise which was a blast.  I would definitely recommend this listing as an option if you want something fun and different.",1
"Gene was great connecting with us.  After we had some difficulty in getting the keys, he met us right away.  He was very responsive to any questions we might have.

The location is ideal right in the heart of the North End a block away from Hanover.  Within walking distance to Fauneil Hall and the T.  

The apartment is clean and well kept.  It was perfect for our stay.  I would request to stay here on our next trip back.",1
Gene was very accommodating and the stay was perfect.  Location is great and place was clean.  We enjoyed everything about our weekend.  ,1
"This apartment could not be in a better location! Located right in the heart of the Old North End, this cozy apartment has a full kitchen, beautiful Crate & Barrel style ambiance, and candles everywhere. Feel like the perfect spot for honeymooners or a couple looking for a romantic adventure. Gene was super responsive -- highly recommend!",1
"Gene is a very warm and welcoming host. He responds quickly to messages and sends clear and detailed instructions.
""The Cove"" was neat, clean and nicer than the pictures. Situated in the north end, the Italian neighbourhood, it is close to just about everything. Nice restaurants, pubs, downtown and the freedom trail. It is just perfect for seeing the best of Boston. And you can do it on foot!",1
"It was a pleasure renting from Gene as he was both responsive and informative. His directions to the lockbox and apartment entry were clear and easy to follow. The apartment was exactly as shown in the pictures and is very well maintained. The location was even better than I imagined. We were 1 block from Mike's Pastries, Paul Revere's House and The Old North Church. And it is just a 3-4 minute walk to the Haymarket T station. The Boston North End has 130 Italian restaurants and is so convenient to any part of Boston by T.",1
"This is such a perfect space if you are visiting Boston.  The apartment itself is cozy & small, but more than enough room for my boyfriend and I.  It is well decorated w modern decor and very clean.  The location is great because it was so easy to walk to nearby attractions and the local restaurants & coffee shops were to die for.  Gene himself was such a great host.  He was quick to respond if I had any questions.  I would highly recommend this one!!!  ",1
Great spot and great host. Gene was very responsive and the apartment was just the right size for a single person or a couple. Nice and dark and quiet at night - I got the best sleep I've had in months. And you can't beat the north end for easy access to great restaurants.,1
Gene has a great place to stay. Compact and high quality finishing all together in a great neighbourhood. ,1
Gene was an amazing host! Very responsive. The apartment is located right in the heart of the North End next to Hanover St. Perfect location to walk around Bostons little Italy and easy access to the MBTA. The apartment was clean and modern and perfect for my weekend stay. Thanks Gene,1
"My friend and I stay at Gene's place while we were in town for job interviews and loved it! It is a cozy little place to come home to after a long day. The location couldn't be more perfect for all that the North End has to offer, as well as, only about a 7 minute walk to Haymarket Station. Gene was also very pleasant to correspond to over the course of our weeks trip, and always available if necessary. I would definitely stay at his place again if the situation ever arose! ",1
"The apartment was very good and clean. It was just like the pictures: modern, with complete appliances (hair dryer, iron, AC, heat, oven, TV, cable, wi-fi, etc), contemporary furniture and design objects. Although the apartment itself was excelent, another amazing feature is the location, which is in a touristic neighborhood, next to several great italian restaurants, 24/7 convenience stores and bakery. 
Finally, I would like to compliment the host, Mr. Gene, that kept me updated with any information that I was suppose to know. We had a little misunderstanding on my arrival, but Gene, knowing the time that I was going to arrive there, kept tuned to his phone to help me when I needed. The good comunication with him was a great attribute to recomend him when booking his place. ",1
"Perfect location in the North End. Complete quiet -- I didn't hear the slightest noise from the street or neighbors. Easy access to the front door key, even after my delayed flight got me there at 1:30 AM. Gene checked in on me to make sure everything was all right, which it was, in every detail. ",1
This was the perfect fit for my husband and I in Boston's North End! The apartment was clean and conveniently located. Gene was available when we contacted him upon arrival and even checked in on us by phone during our stay. This is our first Airbnb and we loved it! ,1
"My husband and I had a great time staying at Gene's place!  The apartment perfectly located in North End, right near the Freedom trail and amongst many fantastic Italian restaurants.  Gene wasn't there to greet us personally, though his instructions on gaining access to his apartment were abundantly clear and made our arrival a very smooth process!  Once we were settled, Gene was great at providing suggestions for restaurants, bars and things to see and do in the area, and checked in with us via email to see how we were going which was great.

I would highly recommend staying here for anyone who is wanting to gain an authentic Boston experience - I will be sure to when I am next in town!",1
"Gene was a great guy, left water in the fridge for us, went and bought a coffee maker/coffee when he found out we like coffee. Told us repeatedly if we needed anything to let him know. Would definitely stay here again, being in the north end was a great location. My wife liked the painting so much I think we're getting one just like it.",1
"Great location for food and history. Apartment was perfect size and had everything we needed. Parking was 34 dollars a day at pilgrim but if you don't need to travel far(Waltham) don't bother with a car. 

Gene's place is about 2 blocks from Paul Revere's house and you'll be walking across the freedom trail multiple times a day. Couldn't have found a better spot to see Boston.",1
"Stayed at this wonderful little apartment over Memorial Day Weekend. Situated in an amazing location, we truly enjoyed all the experiences Boston's North End had to offer. I would definitely recommend this listing to my family and friends. ",1
"My wife and I spent a week in Gene's apartment. We found everything we needed to feel well, the apt is quiet and fully equipped. The surrounding is absolutely picturesque and an ideal basis for a Boston visit. All kinds of services (laundry etc.) and restaurants available. Gene kept close contact and did everything to ensure uncomplicated check-in and check-out. A good experience!",1
Great Stay! Highly recommend Gene. Really nice guy. I'd prefer dealing with him than a hotel any day. It was also very clean.,1
"Great experience all around. Super clean and cozy apartment - perfect for the two of us. Every thing is as it looks in the photos - floors were clean. Exceptionally quiet - had no trouble sleeping. Towels and linens smelled freshly washed. Everything you could need to cook in a kitchen, but why would you want to when so many amazing restaurants are right out your door in this location? Minutes away from everything in Boston - including train stops. Easy to access everything you could want to do from this location. ",1
"The only issue I had with the place, was that I wasn't able to stay longer.  It is a cozy little spot with modern comforts and perfect for my stay.  I didn't get to enjoy it as much as I should've as I was only home to sleep and shower.  Gene kept perfect contact with me and was so accommodating to all my needs as well.  This was my first time using Air BnB and it was such a success! Can't wait to try it out in other cities and visit Gene's Downtown Designer Digs on my next visit to Boston! Nothing better than strolling through the North End, feeling like your waltzing through the streets of Florence but right here in the US! Thanks for everything Gene!! ",1
This was my first air bnb experience and it was great. Gene was easy to work with and very helpful. The apartment was exactly as advertised - clean modern and quiet in the heart of the North end. Great place to stay for a Boston visit.,1
"The apartment was beautiful and clean, and in a great location. We very much enjoyed it, including coffee and coffee maker. Gene was nice enough to let us stash our suitcases while we talked around before heading out to the airport. Everything was nice and easy!",1
"Ideal location in the North End. So many awesome destinations within walking distance! Also easy access to the Subway. 
The apartment is very clean, tastefully appointed and very quiet. 
Highlights of our visit - Freedom Trail tour (with State Parks Ranger), Cannoli from Modern Pastry (Mike's gets all the love!),  Improv Asylum (comedy), Parla cafe/wine bar, Samuel Adams Brewery tour ... too many to list here!
We'd stay here again. ",1
"It was very easy to be in contact with Gene, both before and during my stay. Although the need didn't arise, it was good to know just in case... If you like being in the thick of things, you cannot beat this location or this apartment. Being in the North End was very convenient to everything in the city, and it doesn't take long before you feel like a local. The apartment is perfect. It's small so I wouldn't recommend any more than 3 people (2 in the bedroom and one on the fold-down couch) but it's very clean and accommodating. It's also in the back of the building so even though it's on a somewhat busy street, the apartment is very quiet. The a/c is excellent, as is the internet. And it's very safe! This is an excellent choice for a vacation rental!",1
The apartment is in a great location - very close to everything on Hanover Street and Salem Street.  It's also very clean and comfortable. We had a great time and highly recommend Gene's apartment!,1
"Gene is super fast and responsive. The apt is in a good location with lots of restaurants - very touristy so if you like that, its awesome. It is not noisy and i had a nice stay. The only thing that might have been good to know before hand is that the apt is quite closed with closed windows and i needed to circulate the air by turning on a/c.",1
"My fiancé and I had a wonderful stay.  The apartment is in a great location in the North End of Boston.  It's surrounded by amazing restaurants and historical sites of interest.  The bed was amazing comfortable and the air conditioners offered much relief from the heat.  As the pictures show, the apartment is tastefully decorated.  We would definitely stay again on our next visit.  ",1
"Wonderful.  Fantastic place to stay, clean, beautifully kept and in a perfect location.  Host was fantastic in communication!  ",1
"We had a wonderful stay in this spotlessly clean apartment. It's in a lively, interesting neighbourhood but because it's set back from the street, it was quiet inside. Very convenient and well placed for sight seeing and eating out. We'd absolutely recommend it. ",1
"the apartment was clean, hospitable, and in a fantastic location. james was professional, courteous, and made the trip a breeze.",1
The apartment was exactly as described and photographed.  Nicely appointed and right in the middle of a fantastic neighborhood.  ,1
"Amazing place in the North End area of Boston. Great location that is close to many awesome restaurants. Apartment was extremely clean, cozy, and bed was very comfortable. James was very responsive and helpful during our stay. ",1
James made our stay in Boston's North End fun and easy.  I'm very happy we choose this location and apartment to stay in.  The apartment had everything we could need and the location was the best!  Easy access to the rest of Boston and so much to do (and mostly eat) right outside the door.  We will be back!,1
James was so easy to work with! Perfect little apartment in an ideal location in Little Italy/north end. Super walkable area near lots of great sights and restaurants. I would definitely stay here again on a return trip!,1
"James was great at communicating and walking us through all the steps.  His place was immaculate, elegantly and modernly decorated, and so conveniently located.  Just a stroll down the street will offer delicious Italian restaurant and pastry options, easy access to public transport, and coffee shops.  Highly recommend this and would love to stay again!",1
"We enjoyed our stay immensely. The apartment is beautiful, comfortable , and matched the written description perfectly. The location is great with wonderful restaurants very close. The apartment was also easy to get to from the train station, close to the subway and then easy to get to the airport. ",1
"James was very responsive to communications, his instructions were impeccable, and the place is lovely.  What a great and special location.  ",1
"The neighborhood was off the charts.   My kids and I were loving all the shops, restaurants, wonderful old world culture.  It was the bomb location",1
"We had a wonderful experience with James and his place. He warmly greeted us as soon as we were accepted. A day before our stay, he reached out and gave us all the details on where to find the key and made himself available to any questions we had. We didn't arrive until late, and he still made sure we got in ok. The place was perfect for the two of us. Clean, safe, and in a great location. It is in the heart of the Italian district of North end, so we were surrounded by food, cafes, and history. The place had everything we needed for our stay in Boston. We highly recommend and will stay here again!",1
Although we never met the host communicated well with us and sent directions via email and text message for the unit. The listing is as pictured. The neighborhood feels safe. The near by restaurants and cafe appear are convenient and it is a short walk to Boston Common park and other historical landmarks.,1
Great little place in a cool area of Boston,1
Stay was great. Place was clean and very quiet for sleeping,1
"Our stay was terrific and made us feel like we were locals in Boston!! The apartment was exactly as it was listed and very nice and clean. Although it's a busy area, with lots of people living close by, the apartment was very quiet in the evenings and at night! James was responsive to all of or needs and checked in half way through our trip  to make sure we were comfortable and settled! Overall great place!",1
"James did a wonderful job communicating with me before I arrived to the apartment.  He sent text messages and made it very clear where to get the key to the apartment.  He has a wonderful apartment in a great area!  It is walking distance to a great park, amazing Italian restaurants, and a lot of the history points in Boston!  ",1
"We were satisfied with his home.  The location was perfect.
Thank you for allowing us to stay in your cozy home.",1
"Very quiet, clean, modern and comfortable apartment in the centre of Boston. Excellent location for exploring the City.",1
"This apartment is beautifully styled and well equipped. The location can't be beaten with the freedom trail and many historic sites all within walking distance, and only 5 minute walk to the metro.
James was amazingly helpful and made my stay extremely easy & frictionless.
I can't recommend this apartment highly enough!",1
"Our host made us feel welcome. He had to come over to the apartment to help with the WiFi as the router seemed to be having a problem. We also needed bath soap and paper towels which he quickly provided.
This apartment is in a very convenient neighborhood in north Boston. We loved the Italian restaurants and bakeries and the ability to walk to many historic sights. Thanks James for renting us a great place.
",1
Had a great stay and James made everything very easy.  Apartment was very clean.  The location is fantastic!,1
"James was very helpful, checking in on us before and during the stay to make sure everything was alright. I heard back from him immediately when I had a question. 

We LOVED the neighborhood! Great restaurants, walking distance to almost everything (and a quick, convenient subway trip to anything farther away.) We felt very safe walking around.

The apartment was as described, although it is pretty small (think Manhattan). But it was fine for the two of us, since we spent most of our time out walking around. 

Thanks for a great stay!",1
"James' place was fantastic in every regard:

The check-in process was simple. James sent us step-by-step instructions for check-in that were concise and easy to follow.

The apartment was clean and welcoming and spacious. It was very comfortable.

The location was outstanding. It was very nice to be able to basically walk wherever we wanted whenever we wanted. 

Parking was simple. We paid a $35 flat rate (there was some kind of event parking that nite for something somewhere) for over 24 hours which seemed pretty good to me. The garage I parked in was at the intersection of Causeway and Prince and was only a short walk (five or so minutes) to James'.

Tl;dr: Stay at James' place, you won't regret it.",1
"James was a very responsive, welcoming host. This charming apartment is in a perfect North End location for exploring Boston.  Right off Hanover Street in the North End, a short walk to Quincy Market Fanueil Hall and many other historic sites, attractions and so many great restaurants (and oh, that cannoli!). The place is compact, cozy, comfortable and quiet.  It was perfect for me and my husband and well priced.  We would definitely stay there again.  ",1
Beautiful space in prime location.  Top notch. Clean. Contemporary. Wonderful bed and first rate linens.  Will stay at James's place next time we're in Boston. ,1
"Excellent host, everything was accurate and as described.",1
"Neat little apartment. Beautifully decorated, great furniture, very good bed. We slept like princes! ",1
"I normally plan trips and accommodations well in advance, but when we wound up with an extra day on our hands after a visit to Hartford, CT, I decided to finally visit Boston. I quickly decided that I wanted us to stay in the North End and looked there. James' place just jumped out to me and seemed the obvious choice. Perfect location, very neat and clean - just right. I highly recommend staying here.",1
"I never met James but he was very caring and helpful when I had questions.   The place looked exactly like the pictures on AirBNB.  It is a small apartment but has everything you would need.  It was so quiet although it is in the middle of North End.  I could relax and felt at home.  Thank you, James!  ",1
"My in laws loved living in the North End. What a great location! The apartment is small but compact and well designed. Stylish with upmarket decor and well appointed. It felt like our own place as there were no personal items that belong to the host, lying around. Everything worked well and the apartment was accurately and honestly presented on the Airbnb website. Thanks James, for a great stay! ",1
"Exactly as advertised!  Great place, perfect location.  Thanks James.  We hope we have an opportunity to stay in your space again.",1
"Apt. was exactly as pictured in the listing. Nicely decorated, neat, clean and comfortable. James was out of town but available by text and very prompt responding to my questions. Great location in the North End. Felt welcome and safe in the neighborhood, even after dark. ",1
"A dream apartment in Boston's most charming corner. Everything was perfect: super clean, great bedroom, all beautifully decorated, everything you can need. James was very helpful with immediate replies. Hope to go back. Best Airbnb experience. ",1
"James' place is really amazing: great location, enough space for 1 or maybe even 2 people, and good facilities. I stayed for two weeks and really enjoyed having a 'home away from home' a lot. James kept checking in to make sure that everything was going well. Would definitely recommend!",1
"Loved this apartment - it was beautifully designed, cosy bed and the best spot for exploring Boston.",1
A great apartment in a great central location--I would definitely stay at James's place again.,1
"Charming apartment, perfectly advertised, terrific location! Could not have made a better choice.",1
It is a lovely flat in great location in Boston. Enjoyed the stay a lot!! Flat it is furnished with all you need and the bed is lovely and comfortable! Used the flat as it was own and was very clean ,1
"Great place.  Clean, organized, just right for what I needed: a friendly place to spend the evening while carrying out some business in Boston's North End.   Host is very easy to deal with and he cares about your stay.  ",1
"James was really responsive and friendly, checked in with us after we had settled in to see if we needed anything.

The apartment was in a great location in the North End, just a stone's throw from plenty of Italian restaurants and bakeries and an easy seven minutes walk to Faneuil Hall. It was cozy but clean, functional and has really great heating.

Only minor quibbles are that if you have heavy and sizable luggage like we did, you'll need to lug them up a very short flight of stairs to get to the apartment and there isn't really any space to open your luggage flat in the living room or bedroom.",1
"James's place was beautiful, clean and in an exciting and convenient location for exploring Boston. I also appreciated that James was easy to get in touch with.  

Would definitely recommend his place to others. j",1
"I love the house.Its in the perfect location in center of Boston.Around with beautiful historical buildings and Italian restaurant,I can feel the origin of this city! Thanks James for offering the unforgettable experience in Boston.",1
This is a great location in the heart of Little Italy.  ,1
"Awesome apartment in a great location in North End, walk inking distance to bars, resteraunts and TD gardens. 
A+",1
"Clean, full kitchen, within walking distance of hundreds of excellent restaurants. Would highly recommend.",1
"I stayed over James' place for 10days in January, with my fiancee. We had an wonderful time. The apartment is perfect for two ppl, maybe 4 too, if you don't stay that long and only come to crash. It is clean, comfortable and very, very quite. You can sleep until late, need be, because it's dark, as the windows face a small brick niche. The bed is super comfortable. You have everything you need (dishes, silver, towels, toaster, coffee machine, microwave, stove). The location is awesome, in the heart of the best neighbourhood in Boston - North End. Walking distance to Quince Market, Faneuil Hall, TD Garden, the Aquarium, the T/ underground (green, orange and blue liner) and a million restaurants and pizzerias (check Regina, 5mins away!!!) and pubs catering to all tastes' and wishes (there's even a Sushi place around the corner). 
James was great, not bothering you for no reason but prompt in answering messages and fixing problems if the case - like the bathroom sink wouldn't drain when we got there; we sent him a msg b4 going out and when we got back it's bn fixed already.
So great place, great host. Highly recommend! 
Thank you, James! And enjoy your North End/ Boston experience, ya'll! :)",1
We loved staying in your apartment. Jim and I were concerned about the glass coffee table so we moved a bit out of the way. Your apartment was clean and charming. We would definitely call on you again.  ,1
"My second stay at this nice place, wonderful just like last time. The neighborhood is awesome and the apartment has everything you might need, even for a 10 day stay. James was very accommodating and pleasant. Would recommend for sure!",1
"We had a wonderful stay at James' property. The location was great as it was close to a number of restaurants and cafes. If you're driving into town there is a parking garage located a few blocks away (easy walk to and from the property). Yes, the place is small, but we didn't spend much time here. Everything in the property was nice and clean. We didn't meet James in person, but he checked in a few times to make sure we made it to the property and checked in again halfway through our stay. I would recommend James' place to others and would want to stay here again when we come back in the summer!",1
"Our stay was very pleasant) James was attentive and quick to respond/communicate. The neighborhood was super-nice: you get a chance to experience inside of Little Italy not only in the evening with the rest of the tourists, but also early in the morning when local Padres are drinking their coffee) It also gives you a chance to sneak into famous Mike's Bakery around the corner and try local cannoli early in the morning before masses of sugar-fans arrive) The apartment was just as described in the add - modern, well thought through and pleasant to stay in. The only downside is the lack of direct sunlight (there is only a light shaft, where the windows are located), so it's not exactly perfect for hanging out. Rather than that, it's a great place to come back 'home to' after a long day of new experiences ))",1
"You cannot ask for a better location in Boston to explore the city.  My wife and I both love to visit a 'walking city', and Boston was exceptionally great in that regard.  Most locations we wished to see were within a couple of miles, and many were only a couple of blocks away -- walking the Freedom Trail, visiting old churches and graveyards, seeing the USS Constitution, having a few drinks at a local pub, dining on great Italian food, sushi from the North End Fish Market, and Mike's Pastry (one has to try their connoli!).

On the evening of our arrival, James got in touch with us to make sure that everything was OK and to call him if anything was not to our liking.   Everything was fine and we did not need any assistance from him during our stay

This was our first time using AirBnB.  We will definitely try to stay at Mike's abode again.  We love Boston!",1
"Our host quickly responded to our calls when needing additional information. The space could not have been cleaner....loved that! The bed was extremely comfortable, and quality linens. Well equipped kitchen, but not really used as there were so many amazing restaurants within 2 blocks. Busy fun neighborhood, but apartment is tucked back in and very quiet. Highly recommend!",1
"The area of the apartment is really nice, in the middle of Little italy - a lot of nice Restaurants and Cafes around. Easy to reach and really central! The Apartment is super nice, modern and cozy - definitely a place I would always come back!",1
"James was an excellent host and the apartment was exactly as listed. It's beautifully appointed and very comfortable. The location in the North End is perfect for walking to restaurants, coffee and sightseeing but was also secluded and quiet at night. I would definitely stay here again. ",1
Great place and amazing location. Tons of restaurants and cafes just down the street. An easy walk to any of the Boston sights. ,1
"We never met James but he was really good at communicating during our stay. We stayed for a longer period for both work and holiday, which made the location ideal - it's 5 mins from the T stop/the public market and within walking distance of countless bakeries including the famous Mike's Pastry as well as a 24hour one. It's also one street away from the 'freedom trail'!

The flat is really nicely furnished, quiet and the bed and linen is extremely comfortable. We appreciated the kitchen area and cupboard space. The only downside is the lack of natural light (there is three windows but the light doesn't really reach), which can't really be helped with the location, but we did feel it sometimes if we were in for more than a couple of hours during the day (especially since some lightbulbs were out too for a few days). It's not a major issue though as we were mainly out during the day and it does keep the flat well insulated and warm. Overall we had an excellent and comfortable stay and would highly recommend it. ",1
"This was our first Airbnb experience, and James made it a good one.  He was very good about communicating with us, making sure we go in alright, and that we had what we needed. 

The place was exactly what we expected, from the posting, and the neighborhood was great.  We felt like we were wandering in and out of Italy.

We will definitely stay again, next time we are in Boston.",1
"Place was as shown in photos - stylish, cozy, quiet city escape in a great location. James was super responsive to messages, place was very clean, and even had a hairdryer (ahem, ladies) under the sink. ",1
"James's place turned out to be a good location for me, even though my conference was a little far away.  The T was great and made it easy to get to the North End.  Everything was SUPER clean, and James made sure to confirm that things went smoothly.  Would be happy to stay again!",1
"Sweet apartment in one of Boston's neighborhood gems: the walking is great.  James is an extremely solicitous host.  Sometime minor problems can't be helped (like a burned out bulb), and he went the extra mile to make my stay as comfortable as possible.  Highly recommend.",1
"Highly recommend staying here if you are planning a trip to Boston. The apartment was a perfect size for my wife and I, very comfortable and in an amazing location. Near all the best restaurants and shops in the North End. A short walk to historic landmarks, parks and public transportation. Very safe walkable neighborhood day and night. James was a perfect host. Provided us with all the information we needed to make our stay extremely enjoyable. Can't wait to stay here again.",1
"Beautiful and safe place in Boston. Perfect for a short business trip. Very clean and it looks exactly like the photos. 

James was very kind and helpful. He replies as soon as you needed help. Thanks for being so compromising James. I enjoyed living in your apartment.

Will be back if I do drop by Boston again. Highly recommended. ",1
"The apartment was in the perfect location. We loved walking right out the door and into the middle of the North End! We walked everywhere, saw many sights- so much interesting history, and ate at delicious restaurants. Panza (right around the corner) was probably our favorite! ",1
"Such a great place to stay!!! I highly recommend it!  Super clean and exactly as it was described.  Right in the heart of the North End, quick walk to Quincy Market, right on the Freedom Trail, 20 minutes from Boston Common.  We were so sad to leave.  James was great!  He gave full accurate directions on how to check in and made sure throughout our trip that everything was going great.  If we ever go back we would surely stay there!",1
"James' communication was speedy and very helpful. Everything about the stay was exactly as expected. 

We adored the neighborhood and walked to everything--the aquarium, Boston Common, the Freedom Trail. Excellent location.

 Had there been any sunshine during our stay AND had we spent much daytime in the apt, the view of the brick wall may have bothered us (maybe) but as we mostly just relaxed in the evening and slept, it was no problem at all. It really is a cove, with a cool tunnel entrance.",1
"This was our first experience on Airbnb, and our first international trip with my wife. We are delighted with what we have chosen. James was an exceptional host, always there for us although we didnt get to meet him personally. Location was a 10, surrounded by italian restaurants, close to the TD Garden and the train station, the apartment was almost perfect and pretty cozy, a tv in the living room would have made it superlative. The only difficulty was knowing how to enter the apartment, since we had a 13 hr flight from argentina and we werent able to get the instructions that same day. We had to stay at the caffee on the corner to get them.
Other than that, loved the city and james did a big part on that.",1
Very nice apartment.  Everything we needed was there.  Great location.  Very pleasant experience.,1
James was very respondsive and understanding. The apartment was very nice and clean.,1
"We stayed at James' place for our first trip together to Boston, and we could not have been more pleased! The place was exactly as pictured. James was very accommodating, and responded in a timely manner when we contacted him. We had no trouble finding the place or the lockbox due to good directions. It was a quiet place and very convenient to everything. Thanks so much!!",1
"A and tasteful abode in a phenomenal location! Frequented Bova's for a few days (24 hrs & just steps away...yay!). James was helpful, gracious, prompt, friendly. Perfect!",1
The host contacted me to see if anything was needed.  He also gave outstanding recommendations for bakery and restaurants. ,1
"Easy arrival, great location and beautiful apt.  Very quiet area and apt.  There are several other apts in the building but you would never know it.  You don't hear the people above you and there isn't anyone next to you.  Everything you would need is in the apt and James is very reachable if you need him.  I can't wait to go back.",1
Great location and very nice modern apartment. ,1
"James' place was exactly what I needed this trip - private, easy to negotiate, clean, and comfortable. Everything was easy to use (heat, A/C, wifi). I exercised by running by the water and on a baseball field very nearby. It also is in the heart of Boston's North End which unfortunately I didn't get to enjoy. It would be a great place to have city get-away smack dab in the middle of a great neighborhood. Next time!",1
"The apt is very cozy, clean and convenient. And I love the neighborhood very much,it's very quiet at night and only 5 min's walk to subway station(which has green and orange line). I didn't see James, but he is very helpful and easy to reach. This is the first time I use Airbnb, and have a good experience.",1
James was an excellent host -- incredibly quick to respond to questions and very attentive. The location of this place is unbeatable!,1
This is a perfectly located apartment among the beautiful and historic streets of the North End.  The apartment is modern and clean and James made things very easy for a wonderful stay!,1
"James' apartment was in a great Boston location (in the heart of the North End) and within close walking distance to great bars, restaurants, several T stations and many historic sites in the City.  His apartment was as described in the listing and very clean ... and James was quite accessible, as needed.  Our preference would have been for an apartment with more natural light, but most of our time was spent away from the apartment so that was a minor issue.  All in all, it was a great experience and James was a great host.",1
Wish we had more time! We flew into Boston for a quick night before heading to NH for a wedding. This place was perfect. The location was amazing and allowed us to walk to great restaurants and sight see. James was great and checked in on us to make sure everything was good and see if we had any questions. Would definitely go back. ,1
Very good located apartment with a good price-performance ratio for a short stay. From there you can walk nearly the whole city or you take the nearby metro. Good wifi.,1
Great location in North End and fantastic accommodations. James was great with the communication as well. Thanks again!,1
We had a wonderful time in Boston! We loved the apartment and immediately felt right at home. I would stay here again if I'm ever in the area again. Great location and great restaurants all around!,1
"James' place was the perfect home base for our Boston adventures. We walked all over town and enjoyed the food and energy of the North End. You must get a cannoli on Hanover Street! The bed was very comfortable, the tv was a nice relaxing touch at the end of a long day, and it was convenient to have a kitchen for our leftovers. And we were very thankful for the AC on the hot Boston days! ",1
"James' place was in the heart of the North end, and a great Boston location. No need for a car, it’s within close walking distance to great bars, restaurants, and the freedom trail. James' communication was speedy and very helpful. He told us exactly how to check in and grab the keys. Extremely helpful.  Everything about the stay was exactly as expected, extremely clean and a comfy bed. It was nice having a full fridge and kitchen for the leftovers. It was a great experience and I’d recommend James and this place to anyone.",1
Great location & good use of space,1
Great location. It was fantastic to sample the local Italian restaurants and markets -- not far at all from the harbor itself!,1
The North End is my favorite neighborhood in Boston.  The apartment is in the heart of this special place.  This rental was perfect for two people.  ,1
"Excellent stay. Great location. Quiet and cool, even on incredibly hot days. Bed was very comfortable. Would definitely stay again!",1
The apartment was in a great neighborhood in a very convenient location to most of Boston. The place was very quiet and felt private in the middle of downtown.,1
James was fabulous and helpful! The apartment  was clean and is in the most perfect location. We would absolutely stay again. ,1
We stayed one night at James apartment. It is a very nice little apartment in the middle of North End with tons of restaurants and shops nearby. It is good equipped. There is all you need for a comfotable stay. Communication was easy. We definitely recommend this apartment and James as a host.,1
James' place was great if you want to stay in the heart of Boston and want to be a short walk away from everything. He was very accommodating.,1
 It was very clean and a great place to stay we stayed for one night so convenient to everything we will definitely stay there again ! The north end is the best,1
"This place is off the charts in its location!!Your in the heart of the North End. It is a described, unique and small , but updated for a North End apt. It is so tucked in and quiet but again step out of the apt and you are where everyone wants to be. I stayed here for 5 days and my mother came up from the cape for 2 of those days to stay with me. We were there for the Fishermans Festivial- highly recommend this seafood fest in the North End.. James communication, though I did not get to meet him,  was  fast, quick and caring. He made sure I got in OK and again checked  in with me that everything went well as I left.  I rate James place 5 stars--Location-Location-Location and Communication!!!!
Susan",1
"As a frist time AirBnB'er, James provided as great an experience as I could hope for. The place was clean and well prepared. During our stay, we really learned to appreciate how unique the neighborhood is, the culture is one of a kind. ",1
"James' place was great.  The location was perfect for walking to all the North End historical sights and the Greenway.  We had a car, and local parking was very convenient.  Cozy apartment was so clean and well appointed!  One of our party took the water taxi from Logan and it was a great way to get to the North end with easy access to James' place. We would stay there again!  ",1
Great Location.  Very nice place. Would recommend to anyone that wants to be in North End. Host answered our questions immediately and was very responsive. ,1
"James' place was very comfortable n cozy and close to many spots for breakfast, lunch and dinner even for drinks. We had such a great time and would definitely come back to the area.",1
"The apartment was nice and clean, with an amazing location, steps from Hanover St and right around the corner from the Old North Church. We really enjoyed our stay!",1
We enjoyed our stay in Thomas's beautifully appointed apartment.  His visitor's guide was very detailed and we enjoyed his recommendations for food within walking distance.,1
"Tom's apartment is just perfect if you wanna stay in Boston more than a few days.. It's one of these places where you just feel like home, charming, comfortable, quiet and in a very residentiel area and a great neighborhood.
However, you can walk to many places and if you don't, subways and bus lines are  very close.
Tom is nice and helpful. He takes care of his guests.
A wonderful experience.",1
"Greg was such a sweetheart and a wonderful host! His apartment was cozy and clean and he was very helpful with directions and suggestions for things to do in Boston. Charlestown is such a cute, historic Boston neighborhood and it was very easy to get around. The Freedom Trail was a 5 minute walk away.",1
"Greg was extremely accommodating and welcoming!  The space was clean, neat, and just what I needed for a quick weekend away.  Greg was very helpful with suggestions for activities and the neighborhood was charming.  Everything was within walking distance from the apartment (Bunker hill was basically in the backyard) and I really had a great time exploring Boston!  Would definitely recommend and return.  Thanks for the great time!     ",1
Greg was as great host.  Friendly and is a real clean guy with a clean place.  Worth coming back.,1
"Simple, Safe, Super clean. Awesome neighborhood. Greg is my type of host. Like a good waiter, available but not intrusive.",1
"It was my first airbnb experience and I was not disappointed at all.
The hosts are super friendly! I was warmly welcomed and they are really willing to help when necessary. The house is modern and has everything it needs (and more). I slept very well.
Nothing bad to say about this bnb, I definitely recommend it !
",1
"Mounir is the perfect host! During my semester abroad in the US, I stood in his apartment. The apartment is really gorgeous and adorably furnished and Mounir made my stay very comfortable all the time. The best part of the apartment (in my eyes) is the well-equipped and beautiful kitchen, inviting  you to cook a lot :) I highly recommend staying in this wonderful apartment, if you are discovering Boston.  ",1
Wonderfully kind and helpful!!!! Very very genuine and nice people! ,1
"This was my first Airbnb experience and it was perfect for my needs. Mounir was very welcoming and helpful when I arrived. The location was ver convenient for me, and the home was very clean and spacious. It was great for a quick stay between living situations. ",1
"Mounir's place was great! I had an excellent stay, the apartment is spacious, clean, and comfortable. Mounir's cute cat also adds to the charm!",1
"My stay in Dorchester was enjoyable and hospitable. I got to stay in Mounir's lovely home and see Boston at a reasonable price. He has a beautiful, clean home and I enjoyed the company of his cat, whom he calls ""kitty"". ",1
Never able to connect with Mounir personally due to conflicting work schedules. He was prompt and helpful via mobile telephone.  I felt self and comfortable as a single female. Easy 12 minute walk to T station. Would absolutely stay here again.  Love your cat. We bonded ,1
Mounir was very nice and accommodating. Recommended and parking was plentiful in front of his house.,1
"Although I did not actually end up staying at Mounir's place, he was incredibly understanding, kind, and flexible. Given my circumstances, he even gave me a partial refund. His hospitality was definitely noted! ",1
"Mounir was an awesome host. He was willing to go above and beyond by waiting until early morning to greet my aunt. He always smile and very friendly. The place is really nice, spacious and clean. Overall, my aunt had a great experience staying here, and thank you so much for that! ",1
"Clean room , bed sheet, big closet. Everything is as same as described. And a very cute cat ! ",1
"My stay here went well. The host was communicative in the few instances I had questions, and the location is fairly close to public transportation. The lodging was also affordable given the week or so I stayed. My only complaint is that there aren't many restaurants near this location, so odds are you will have to travel elsewhere if you want to eat before going to downtown Boston. Everything else was fine, though!",1
"It was a good stay, mounir is really cool and helpful. The place is clean and I am sure you all will have a good stay. It's a good neighbourhood on the top of it, I mean safe.",1
"Great place , calm neighborhood , friendly people ..
Mounir and his room mate, are nice and friendly
The room and house interior is clean and nice .. Easy transportation from and to red line station, either by 12min walk or 201/202 buses",1
Clean room and quite. But I didn't see Mounir during the stay. ,1
"Mounir was helpful to help me check in. His place is quiet, 10 minute to grocery, 5 minute to DLR station and it takes less than 20 minutes to get Canary Wharf. The room is small but clean. Plus I had access to the kitchen. The only drawback was that the trash was full when I arrived, probably it was because that Mounir was away. But his roommate handled the trash once I contacted Mounir. Overall the price is unbeatable and I would recommend the place to others.",1
I had a great experience. The location is a 10 minute walk to the train stop which made everything accessible ,1
"Mounir and I didn't actually see each other during my short stay, but he made sure I had all the information I needed in order to get in to the apartment the night I arrived.  The room was impeccably clean and comfortable, and I had a nice time staying there.  The neighborhood was very quiet, and although it was a little further from the train stop than I thought it would be, it was still within walking distance.",1
"Mounir is a very nice host, the place is warm, and he is very flexible to my request when I found out my daughter  need spent one night with me when she needed move out on 8/31.

Thanks

Terrific value and would definitely recommend!",1

This would be a great base to explore Boston.  And the breakfast had many organic, Whole Foods selections - wish I had room for more!  Would love to stay again.",1
"Lana was a great host and her place was described accurately. We liked that apartment was near maverick square (food and drink) and the train station. 

We left early and returned late and it didn't interfere with her schedule. Bedroom and bathroom were small but worked for us since we were gone frequently. We had a bad experience with her neighbor that I won't fully describe but if you are private person or loud person you may not appreciate the neighbor. Lana was great but neighbor impacted our stay.

Lana was very hospitable.,1
Lana welcomed my parents very warmly. They felt like they were at home. Her place is really beautiful. I am glad I booked her place for my parents and will surely book her place whenever I visit. Thanks a lot Lana ,1
Lana was awesome! That might have been the best Airbnb experience we had so far. Her place was clean and beautiful. It was easy to get to the next Metro Station and the Airport is just a few minutes away. We wished we could have stayed longer but Lana's place is justifiably popular. Thank you for making our last days in Boston so wonderful.,1
"My husband and I had a wonderful time at Lana apartment. Lana is a very nice person and prepares delicious and healthy breakfasts! Also she was very comprehensive and tried to adapt to our schedule.
The apartment is beautifully decorated and very clean. It's 15 min to the nearest metro station, but the neighborhood seemed safe enough to walk around at night.
",1
"We had a great stay at Lana's place in Boston. Lana was easy to get in touch with before the trip and was flexible when our arrival time moved back by a couple of hours.

We enjoyed our time. This is an excellent value!",1
Lana was a very sweet and sincere host. Her home is beautiful and spic and span! The cleanest airbnb I've seen! she also offered free range to her fridge filled with healthy foods.

"Lana's place was very nice. We only had a short stay for an overnight layover, but appreciated the comfort of her place and her hospitality. The room was private with a comfortable bed. With our short stay we didn't make use of the kitchen which she made fully available to us, even the food! We walked to and from the airport which was close and the neighborhood felt very safe and quiet. Even though it was close to the airport, we heard no noise from planes. Lana communicated well with us before our arrival with quick responses to our questions. She met us at the door to let us in and was even kind enough to walk us to the harbor and give great information. We will have to come back to Boston to really enjoy the beauty of this city.",1
My one-night stay at Lana's place was very enjoyable and relaxed. She was very sweet and hospitable. The neighbourhood is interesting and within easy reach from the airport as well as the South Station.,1

The bed was particularly comfortable and very welcome after our long journey.,1

The room was small but great (husband very tall and found it a bit awkward to get to bed). Bed sooo comfortable. Apartment very clean. Breakfasts very healthy and tasty, especially the pancakes! Close to the T and the airport but little noise. Lana herself very helpful and accommodating.",1
Lana met us at the door when we arrived.  She showed us the guest room that we would be using.  She explained how to get to the train.  She made a healthy oatmeal for breakfast that we unfortunately did not get a chance to finish because we were in a hurry to get on the road.  ,1
"The room is small. however it was very clean and comfty bed, Lana was helpful and nice, made a yomy breakfast and healthy. The area was a nice latin neighborhood, easy to take the metro, only 10 min walking.",1

Das Appartment von Lana ist in einer ruhigen Gegend und sehr nah an einer Subway Station mit nur einem Stop nach Boston Innenstadt.
Die Wohnung ist sehr sauber mit einem Badezimmer für alle, keine Probleme, das Schlafzimmer ist klein aber für die Nacht ausreichen.
Klimaanlage ist vorhanden, das Bett ist ok.
Lana macht ein Super leckeres Frühstück , Bio, damit kann der Tag beginnen. Alles in allem sehr zu empfehlen. Wir habe viele Tipps bekommen und hatten viele Gespräche",1
Excellent visit to Boston. Staying in Lana apartment was comfortable,1
Lana was very accommodating and nice to visit with. The breakfast was delicious and the location was very convenient for getting to the airport. Lana is a great person and we enjoyed our stay,1

"Lana was truly a great host. With a fine room, all the things you could expect in it, and the added bonus of a wonderful breakfast, Lana provides great value, very close to the airport, in an interesting and safe neighborhood.
I obviously recommend Lana's place wholeheartedly.",1
Lana is a wonderful host and her location is fantastic.  She even made us a homemade pancake breakfast!  ,1
"Lana was a wonderful host! Her apartment is very clean and having the AC in our room was a big plus. Stayed there before an early flight which was great because her place is an ~8 min drive to the airport. Lana also offered free range of her fridge which was so sweet, even though I didn't need anything before my early departure. ",1
"Lana was a great hostess!  She is very kind and helpful.  She made us breakfast every morning.  On the Sunday, she took the time to join us for breakfast, which was really nice.  Her home is beautiful, very clean and safe.  The pictures found on her airBnB web-page are accurate.
  
Her house is located in a great location.  You can walk to the Blue Line from her place with takes you to downtown Boston.  You can also walk to the Silver Line at the airport, which will take you to South Boston.  If you flying into Boston, I would recommend that you take the taxi to her place, as the exit for pedestrians is difficult to find.  The taxi is about 10$US.

The bedroom is a decent size.  The bed is a good size, enough room for two people. Pillows are soft, not my personal preference but I had a comfortable sleep. The bedroom has an A/C unit, which cools the room quickly.  On the dresser, there are multiple flyers and maps of activities in Boston, which helped us get around.

If you are visiting Boston, I would highly recommend staying at her house.",1
"Lana was very friendly, accommodating and helpful. The location was great for my very early morning flight. I was able to walk to the airport in the morning - it's about a 20 minute walk and Lana provides a map to show the way.  My friend was able to stick around for Lana's breakfast in the morning and said to report that it was ""delicious and healthy, with lots of fresh fruit."" Would definitely stay here again!",1
"Lana was a great hostess! She is very friendly, kind, helpful and accommodating. She was very accommodating when my flight was delayed. She was okay that my best friend checked in for me instead since he's flight was on-time. Our stay at Lana's place was very nice and cozy. The place was nicely organized, very clean, quiet and in an excellent location. It's close to the airport and quick walk to the blue line metro. I would definitely rebook with Lana when I'm back in Boston. Thank you Lana for your hospitality. ",1

Lots if towels, nice lotion, drinks in fridge

Great breakfast, too

Walkable to Logan Airport

Nice neighborhood, close to all Maverick Sq has to offer

"Lana was a very good Host in a nice home. We slept very well and enjoyed the wonderful Breakfast. The house is not very far from the Subway, so it was possible to come pretty fast to Boston Downtown. We also enjoyed the  good Tea, Lana made for us, when we came back in the evening. So we had our private Boston Tea Party ....",1
Lana welcomed us into her home.  It is a lovely apartment on Boston's East side. The apartment is spotless and beautiful.  The room we stayed in was extremely comfortable and well furnished.   We were renting a room but Lana opened her home to us and allowed us to use the kitchen so that we could make our own dinner.  We unfortunately missed breakfast as our plane was leaving at 5 am.   The apartment is extremely  close to the airport.  ,1
"we stayed at Lana's place for two nights. Lana should have the Super host because thats what she is. she is super nice snd friendly, super clean, her breakfast is super healthy and tasty and everything about our staying there was beyond amazing.
her house is close to the blue line subway and about one station to the center of Boston. we recommend to stay with her. we got a new friendm thank you Lana.",1
"Lana was very inviting and accommodating! I wish we could have stayed in Boston longer. The location is within walking distance of the Maverick T station, and within ""walking"" distance of the airport (but we didn't really hear a lot of planes, which was nice!). It was incredibly clean and well kept, and the breakfast Lana made for us was delicious!",1
"The listing is located close to the airport, and so it made a perfect stop-over for an early morning flight. The room is as described, and Lana was a very friendly and helpful host. She accommodated our slightly out-of-the-ordinary check-in and check-out times, which was very helpful. Since we had to leave for our flight very early the next morning, we left before Lana was able to make us breakfast, but she instead kindly made up some breakfast for us the night before and left it in the fridge for us. Thanks for an excellent stay!",1
Lana made us feel very welcome during our short stay. She met us at the door and provided clear information on how to get in and out of the apartment. Everything was very clean and tidy. Breakfast was delicious and much appreciated! Thanks Lana!,1
We had a wonderful stay and Lana was very welcoming and cooked a fabulous breakfast!,1
"Lana was great. Our flight from London was late so we didn't get to her place until 10:00 pm (we did pre warn her) and it was no problem. 

If you want a place close to the airport, but not disturbed by aircraft noise, Lana's place is well situated.

Unfortunately we had to leave next morning and so could do any exploration of her area, but from the taxi ride, there seem a choice of places to go to. ",1
"We had a fantastic experience staying with Lana. She made arrival extremely easy for us and did everything she could to make our stay as comfortable and seamless as possible. To top it all off, the breakfast she made for us in the morning was outstanding. We wanted a place close to Logan Airport and would definitely stay there again. ",1
"The apartment is so, so, so super clean. Walking without shoes is no problem (very rare)!!! The airport and the rental car center is just around the corner. Lana was amazing and she even let us drop off our luggage before midday so we could explore the city without our suitcases. She also prepares a really wonderful homemade oatmeal with fresh fruits for her guests. I would give 100 from 100 points in all categories!!!",1
Really good experience! My mom and I enjoy the organic breakfast every morning!Lana is so nice and gives us a lot of help!The location is good since it is near the airport and only takes several minutes to get to the blue line subway station.,1
"Nice and comfortable stay. Lana was really kind and helpful. We arrived at Boston airport and took a walk to the appartment. It is really close, but no flight noise at all. The appartment is clean and comfortable. Breakfast was prepared by Lana and super tasty. Unfortunately we didn't have the time to catch up so much (arrived at 10pm and left at 10am next day).",1
"Lana was very quick to respond to my booking request, questions and any other communications. She was very easy to work with re my travel plans.The accommodations were especially clean, well-supplied and as shown in her listing. It was perfect for me to be able to stay within walking distance of Logan Airport.",1
"We enjoyed our one night stay at Lana's place. Was so convenient to Logan Airport and downtown Boston. 
She greeted us at the door. And was so helpful in providing information on getting around the city. Her place was so clean with all amenities.
 Since we left for Cape Cod early, Lana made us a delicious breakfast and left it in the fridge. 
Would definitely stay there again.

Gregory's Apartment was just as described - charming and bright. A very comfortable place to stay for a couple or close friends. The extra-deep jacuzzi bathtub was delightful and the bed comfy. Fantastic neighborhood and convenient to public transit.,1
"A excellent apartment in Boston, very clean, have everything that one expects to find in that apartment. Everything in the apartment are lovely. Also it has a nice location. It is in downtown Boston, also 10 mins away from Cambridge. I really enjoy live in there. ",1
"The apt is amazing and very nearby coffee places and some cute restaurants. The pictures taken ar exactly like the place: Beautiful, clean and charming, also it is in a very quiet neighborhood. Wi fi worked well and i could work from the house. Dealing with Gregory was easy and he responded very fast to our requests! I loved it. I wish i could live there ;)",1
Perfect space and perfect location.  Greg was wonderfully responsive and flexible with my check in since the booking allowed for it. This location is my go to for boston visits moving forward. Close to all my favorite dining and a safe location for a woman traveling solo. ,1
"This was a charming place in the South End. Plenty of restaurants nearby within walking distance and a T-ride away from central Boston. Gregory was very accomodating and followed up to ensure that we had what we needed. We felt at home and that is in no small part to Gregory. The description is accurate, a studio apartment with private bath. Comfortable, clean, and nicely furnished. The bed is a double and it is a third floor walk-up, but my husband and I enjoyed it greatly. woukd recommend!",1
"Everything was great with my stay. This is a very nice place,  and the neighborhood is terrific. I would stay here again if I go back to Boston.",1
"Greg was a fantastic help right throughout my stay. From picking up the key to leaving the apartment, I found the whole experience very easy which was great since it was my first visit to the city.
The apartment is as described, and is indeed charming and a really nice place to stay. I walked every where from the apartment and it is a very easy spot to get around the city.
I would thoroughly recommend for you to stay.",1
"Gregory was kind and easy to communicate with. The apartment is as described in the pictures and very neat. It's on the top floor with narrow stairs. The neighbourhood is quiet but unfortunately you can hear your house neighbours fairly well. I'm not sensitive to sounds but I had some early mornings (5.30) because that's when may neighbour stood up.
From the apartment it's a nice 10-15 min walk to Copley square or there's public transportation to most parts of Boston. I recommend this apartment.",1
"The listing was very accurate, looks just like the pictures. Very spacious and in a very nice neighbourhood. Had no problems what so ever and Greggory was very helpful in suggesting places to eat etc.",1
"This was just a perfect experience. The apartment is beautifully set up with all the amenities that you could ever want. The location is incredible, safe, and right by great restaurants, a grocery store, and public transportation. Gregory was wonderful to communicate with too. I can't think of a single negative thing to say.",1
"The apartment was accurately represented by the pictures online, and was clean and very welcoming. Short walk into the main attractions through safe neighbourhoods. Host was very responsive with queries and we overall loved our stay. ",1
My stay at Greg's place was great! The apartment was clean & had everything I needed for my week while I worked from Boston. The kitchen had all the essentials & there were even a few items in the refrigerator & cabinets for cooking. The location was perfect with many restaurants & shops. Everything I needed was within walking distance. It was easy to park & close the highway for commuting. Greg was a fantastic host. He communicated promptly and it was very easy to receive & drop off the keys. My puppy stayed with me as well & enjoyed the apartment & loved going on walks to the nearby dog park. I would highly recommend Greg's apartment & would love to stay again on my future work trips to Boston.,1
"We had a great stay at Greg's condo.  It was as pictured in the listing -- very clean with a lot of natural light.  The bed was comfortable (and was a standard double bed - I know one reviewer said that it was small, but we found it to be the size of a regular bed).  Accessing the condo was a breeze.  Greg was very responsive to the few questions we had.  ",1
"Pefect airbnb experience: Greg arranged a very smooth checkin, the apartment was very clean, bright and larger than the photos suggest. Location very convenient for Boston & Cambridge and a nice neighbourhood feel. Thoroughly recommended.  ",1
"Gregory's studio was well appointed, and in a great part of town.  Gregory was very kind, and responsive to any questions we had.  Key pick up was simple.  The guidebook provided had wonderful recommendations.  We would definitely stay there again!
",1
"Very nice apartment - light, airy, and comfortable. A lovely neighbourhood. Gregory was most responsive and easy to deal with.",1
"Very nice, clean, bright condo. Good location . Please, note - very steep staircase ( condo is on the third floor), and no elevator .",1
Cute and clean place in a great location! Gregory was very quick to answer any questions I had.,1
Although we never met Gregory he was always very accommodating and prompt with his communication and his instructions to access the apartment was very easy. No problem whatsoever  Never having been to Boston it was an ideal location - only 10-15 walk along Washington Street got you to the T line and if you didn't want to walk the Silver line bus stop was located 30 seconds from the apartment - just steps away so perfect if you weren't inclined to walk ( we like to walk)  .Foodies (grocery store) is right around the corner so convenient!.   The apartment was clean and bright and I would definitely stay here again.  Thanks Gregory - we had a great time! ,1
"A great experience in the South End of Boston! Gregory was very hospitable and responded quickly to any questions I had. The apartment is gorgeous and very bright. Wonderful tub and a beautiful kitchen with a fantastic gas stove. 

I felt very at home during my stay and enjoyed the neighborhood immensely!",1
"Greg was a pleasure to work with. He made the booking process very easy, was quick to respond to our questions, and checking in/out was simple. The condo has everything you need with a full kitchen, washer dryer, extra towels and linens, kitchen table for 4, flat screen TV , and wireless access. It's quiet so you can get a good night sleep while still being walking distance to some of the best restaurants in the city.  Also very convenient to foodies market, the new Ink Block Whole Foods, as well as the SOWA farmers market for those that plan on an extended stay and want access to grocery's. Overall a great value and awesome location.",1
"I enjoyed my stay in Gregory's airy and bright apartment. He provided everything I needed including food, toiletries and wine.  The place was clean and close to great restaurants and shopping.  I intend to stay here again on another visit to Boston. ",1
"There is no need to hesitate when considering to book this wonderful AirBnb. Everything was just as described and shown in the pictures, and Gregory went above and beyond to make us feel at home. The apartment was bright with a lot of natural light, and very clean. The location was perfect! Close to the ""T"" and many cute up and coming shops/restaurants. During our 3 night stay, we felt as if we actually lived in Boston! The washer/dryer really came in handy. Would definitely recommend to anyone interested in seeing what Boston has to offer!",1
"Gregory's studio is a perfect place to explore Boston. We did most of it by foot, but public transportation is also just around the corner. So are several nice small cafes, bars and restaurants.
The apartment is small, but bright and clean and got all we needed for a few days stay. The only thing to remark is that the bed is relatively small for two tall persons, but I guess that's a matter of what you are used to. All arrangements and communication with Gregory were easy and smooth. He responded quickly to any question, e.g. where to get a drink on the night of our arrival or where to rent bikes for the day. That made things easier for us. So all in all a good place to stay. I can definitely recommend it.",1
"A great base for our three day stay in Boston. Everything you need in a bright, cheerful and very clean apartment. 

Public transport is just round the corner, but the centre of Boston is in easy walking distance, and there are plenty of local restaurants and bars to explore.",1
"Very clean, excellent location, and seamless process.",1
"Really nice apartment. Clean, good location, everything you need.
Didn't get a chance to meet Greg but excellent comms, very helpful and everything went smoothly.
A couple of steep flights of stairs if you have heavy suitcases.",1
Great Stay in a nice and quiet neighborhood. Clean studio. ,1
I booked this apartment for a colleague of mine who was travelling for business. She really enjoyed this apartment! She said it was perfect for someone travelling alone or even for a couple. Gregory was easily accessible and quick to respond to any inquiries. If we are ever in Boston again I will surely be booking this apartment. Thank you Gregory!,1
"This apartment is in such a good location. Having never been in Boston before, we were taking a little bit of a gamble in booking. But, this place really fit the bill. It is surrounded by great restaurants and coffee shops and it is an easy walk into downtown. The apartment was very clean when we arrived and finding the lockbox with the keys was simple because it is just down the street. Gregory was an attentive communicator and we had no issues! ",1
One of the best we have ever stayed in . A real home from home in a great location and gregory was  an excellent host. Really helpful even to the extent of buying and bringing over a bath plug within 15 mins  when the  bath plug  wouldnt seal . Prompt response at all times and good recommendations for  eateries . Easy key pick up ,1
"Gregory was a wonderful host for a weekend in Boston. A busy one too - New Years! We never saw him, but he made sure me and my bf  had everything we needed by often communicating with us. The apartment was welcoming, clean, and had everything we needed. I would definitely stay here next time I am in the South end of Boston. We arrived late, so we couldn't find street parking. Instead, Gregory suggested a place for overnight parking that was close - $33/night, a good deal for the security you get. Thanks for a great stay, Gregory!",1
"Gregory's apartment was very welcoming, very clean,  with nice neighbor in a nice neighborhood. I will go back there  given the opportunity. Gregory was very prompt on communicating with me and that was very much appreciated. I hope to stay at your place again for my next visit. Thank you, Jessie",1
"Gregory was a fantastic host. He was very responsive and communicative with us before and during our trip. Pick up of the keys was simple; he even accommodated us with an early and late check in. 

The apartment itself was spotless, organized, larger than expected and warm. If you told me I had to live in this apartment as my primary residence I wouldn't even bat an eyelash. 

Had some negative experiences based on construction in the building but this isn't the norm for guests.",1
"Though we didn't get to meet Gregory, he was still an awesome host.  The studio was beautiful, large, bright and clean, we absolutely loved it.  The studio is located in a slightly residential area but within walking distance from some nice trendy restaurants and pretty much everything and if you don't feel like walking there's a bus down the block.  Communicating with Gregory was very easy and he answered quickly.  To be honest we would love to move the studio to NYC to live, it's that great.  We would gladly stay there again. ",1
"Gregory is an amazing host. He was very responsible, accommodating, and friendly. The apartment is very comfortable, and has everything you need (and a whole lot more). Its in a great location. Highly recommend this place!",1
Great apartment in a great neighborhood.  Greg was very helpful and welcoming.  Would definitely stay again.,1
"Greg was an excellent host. He was a quick at responding and even was able to accommodate an early check in request.  The studio was perfect in size, location and accommodations. We love it. ",1
"Extremely comfortable, clean, bright and sunny apartment. Excellent and safe location. Really easy check-in/out. Perfect communication with Gregory. Over all a fabulous experience. My husband said that if he was going to live in Boston, he wouldn't mind moving right into that space. Perfect size for two people for a short stat. ",1
"Very nice well furnished apartment. The AC broke (as they inevitably do on the first hot days of summer), but the host was able to install a window unit ASAP which remedied things nicely.  We would certainly stay here again. ",1
Greg was a great host. He was easy to get in touch with and was very attentive to our needs. The studio was in a great location and only a 6 minute walk to the Back Bay T station. There were a lot of great restaurants in the area like Barcelona and B&G Oysters.  I would definitely rebook again.,1
"Awesome spot in Boston that was an easy walk for me to work as well as plenty of nightime activities. The studio itself was well stocked and clean on top of very comfortable.

Gregory did a great job with communications, never leaving me waiting with questions. Both arrival and departure were a breeze and I'll admit I already miss the place!",1
"Gregory provided clear and timely communications.  The apartment was just as described in an nice neighborhood and within walking distance to where we needed to be. When we needed a can opener, he brought one over for us quickly.",1
"We really enjoyed our stay! The apartment was cozy, clean and bright and very convenient to everything we wanted to do in Boston. Greg was a terrific host. Would definitely stay here again for our next trip to Boston! ",1
"I had a terrific stay at Gregory's South End apartment.  At arrival the apartment was laid out in a very comfortable, homey manner.  In terms of location I doubt you can do better.  The apartment is easy walking distance to many South End restaurants and comfortable walking distance to the Museum of Fine Arts, downtown and even the Esplanade.  Also, it is less than a ten minute walk to Whole Foods which was a great resource during the stay.  The neighborhood is very quiet with little traffic noise.  Finally, for me, the apartment was worth booking just to enjoy the amazing winding staircase.  ",1
"We had a lovely time at Greg's place. Greg is a great host, always easy to contact and helpful. The location was great and the apartment was beautiful! ",1
"This apartment is wonderful. Airy, light, well-appointed, spacious-feeling for a studio. I recommend it whole-heartedly.",1
"Gregory's studio in the South End was great.  Looks exactly like the pictures. Neighborhood has many great places to eat and visit within walking distance.  My only complaint is a small one: the bed was a bit small and my legs hung off, but then I'm a very tall person.  Greg was quick in all communications, and it was a very smooth trip.",1
"This was a great first experience with Airbnb. From the beginning Gregory was very timely in his response to all the questions I had as a first timer. There was also great communication during our stay. Painters were going to be in the stairwell, and Gregory informed us well in advance so it wasn’t a surprise when we left the apartment. As for the apartment itself, it was clean and exactly as the pictures showed. The central air was a welcome relief during the heat wave. The neighborhood was fantastic, close to great restaurants and an easy walk to anywhere you would want to go. Overall, it was just a great experience. ",1
We arrived at a cosy and clean studio with all the things you may need supplied for us. The studio is in a top location and we walked everywhere. We went to some of the bakeries on Greg's guidebook and liked them a lot. We had a unforgettable time!,1
What a great little loft to stay in! So clean and welcoming. Gregory let us check in early due to our plane arriving so early in the morning. Everything worked out perfectly. The loft is in a very quiet building and the neighbors are all very polite. There are some great restaurants and shops near by that we walked to everyday! I'd recommend this to all travelers!,1
"Excellent location and nice apt. Clean and quiet and enough room to move around. Nice to have a kitchen and washer and dryer. Greg was easy to communicate with 
And everything went smoothly.",1
"Great location and extremely quiet area
Met all my needs - owner was attentive and prompt response to a question i had - I'll definitely come back for future Boston trips 
",1
Communication with Gregory was fast and easy. The apartment was in an excellent location within he south end of Boston. We arrive to a very clean place with all of the amenities that we need to make our stay comfortable. It was so nice to have a washer and dryer too. We visited some of Gregory's recommendations and they were great. ,1
We enjoyed our stay in Gregory's apartment. The apartment was conform to the pictures and description. The neighbourhood is really nice and quiet. We would definitely stay again!,1
"Fanstastic apartment, with a superb location (Navy Yard) between Bunker Hill and North End. It is a few steps away from the Freedom Trail and the USS Constitution, a must see in Boston! The apartment had everything we needed for a very pleasant stay. Transportation was not an issue, we took Uber (around US10-15 to most places we went in Boston and Cambridge), but there are other options, such as buses and even water taxi! There are a food shop and great restaurants nearby, which is very handy. Totally recommend it! 

Kristin was always very helpful and available to answer our questions prior to and during our stay. ",1
"I totally enjoyed my stay in Kristins condo. The Place was exactly like the pictures, very clean and comfortable. The Location is also great, you can Walk to the Navy yard, take the Ferry or Bus and there is also a Supermarket near by. Kristin made everything so easy, was always available and answered messages right away. I would definetly stay in her Apartment again, but next time longer ",1
"Everything was exactly as pictured/described. The neighborhood and apartment were both clean, quiet and convenient. Very enjoyable experience. ",1
"Staying in Kristin's apartment made my boyfriend and I feel right at home while visiting a new city.
Everything looked exactly like the photos, it was very clean and had more space than we could use.
There was a laundry card provided and the parking spot was very close by.
The neighborhood of Charlestown felt safe even at night time and had it's own historical attractions.  The USS Constitution is a 5 minute walk from the apartment! 
Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Kristin but she was prompt with her replies whenever I had questions and made it very easy for us to gain access into her apartment.

I highly recommend staying in this lovely apartment while visiting Boston.",1
We absolutely loved Kristen s condo. It was clean comfortable and beautiful.  The location was top notch!  The restaurants she recommended were superb. She was available in a pinch! One of our top airbnb stays! It's our new go to place in Boston !,1
"The pictures and description were absolutely on point. The apartment was very nice and clean. The neigh or hood was perfect, you could walk to a variety of excellent places, most of which were recommended by the host. The details in the home made the experience excellent. Detailed instructions were very helpful.",1
"Kristin was a very welcoming and helpful host.  She was excited about her city and was extremely organized, having left for us a printed schedule of the ferry, along with a variety of travel guides and a very helpful local magazine with tips for great things to do in the city.  Most importantly in our case, Kristin was extremely flexible and accommodating.  We had a super early arrival and a late departure, and Kristin was willing to adjust check-in and check-out times to facilitate our ability to make the best of our stay.  She was very responsive and thought about everything, leaving detailed notes for whatever you could possibly need.",1
"Everything was perfect. Kristin's description of where she lived was exactly what we got. Her place was clean and neat with everything you could need. My husband and I liked the location in the navy yard  because it was quiet and only a $3 and 10 minute ferry ride to downtown. Much better alternative to a hotel! Plus, Kirstin's communication with me was fast and always answered my questions. Thank you!",1
"Our trip to Boston was nothing short of spectacular and one of the biggest reasons was Kristin's apartment! It was exactly as the listing said. Kristin's home was so welcoming and comfortable. Everything was spotless and she provided us with everything we could have needed. 

Charlestown was spectacular! Very quiet and charming. The USS Constitution and USS Caussin Young were all of about a 4 minute walk away. Kristin's suggestion of visiting Pier 6 (which was even closer and only one of many suggested places to visit) was great, such a perfect place for an afternoon drink and bite to eat. Also a great neighborhood to go for a run in. 

The ferry to downtown was also only a 5 minute walk away and came every 30 minutes during the week (Kristin also provided us with a ferry schedule). However, if it's a really nice day, you can walk right over the bridge into downtown in about 15-20 minutes. 

We had a great time staying in Charlestown and if, more like when, we come back to Boston, we'll most definitely be looking to stay at Kristin's apartment.  ",1
"Kristin was the PERFECT host.  This was our best Airbnb experience to date.  The apartment was spotless!  Kristin was very flexible with us checking in early and checking out late. She always responded right away to any questions.  The apartment was quite roomy with two huge tvs! The bed was great (we didn't even miss our own bed). 
We loved the neighborhood because it is within walking distance of the north end/td garden/north station (less than a mile over the bridge ) but still a quiet place to come home to.  You can pick up the freedom trail right by the apartment, take the T ferry over to the aquarium/harbor/whale watches ($7 each round trip)  There is a convenience/grocery store a couple blocks away.  

Could not have asked for a better place for our first trip to Boston!  ",1
My boyfriend and I had a fabulous time in Charlestown!! The apartment was immaculate and in a great location. Kristen was a great host and was always available. Would highly recommend!,1
"AMAZING! Kristen's place was perfect. Immaculately clean, and decorated like a magazine display home! Location is quiet, beautiful and easy to get to and from the city. The personal touches of being able to do laundry and use have coffee was so welcoming and helpful. And with a dedicated parking spot and wifi, it's a perfect location for overseas travelers! Our best AirBnB experience to date!",1
"We stayed for 5 nights in this beautiful, perfectly located apartment. We were originally booked in for 4 nights but loved it so much we extended our stay. It's is a brilliant place to stay to explore Boston. The host was amazing and so generous. Recommend to anyone.",1
"Kristin's condo is a great space.  Perfect for two people.  Really clean, helpful information left about the area  (restaurants, attractions,  etc) and in a really nice location.  I would definitely stay there again and recommend it to others.  Kristin was very accommodating and flexible on our check-in and check-out times. It made our stay even that much nicer.   Thank you.",1
Kristin was a great host and we loved how quiet the neighborhood is and also how accessible it is to get to the heart of the city. Great views along the waterfront for a nice evening walk. Adorable condo and very comfortable. Would definitely recommend!!,1
Kristine was a phenomenal host! Her place looks exactly like the pictures. Everything was nice and clean. Kristine left brochures for suggestions as to what to do in Boston and was even able to do laundry at her condo. If your ever in Boston to visit I highly recommend to stay here! ,1
"My boyfriend and I absolutely loved staying at Kristin's place! It was very clean, and the neighborhood was super peaceful and quiet and felt very safe! She even made us some fresh lemon water for the weekend! I would definitely stay again on my next return to Boston! ",1
Kristin's home was wonderful and she was extremely accommodating! It was the perfect location to hop on the ferry and/or T and get anywhere in town. Great value! :-) ,1
"I can't say enough to do justice to the loveliness of Kristin's condo. The space is just as it is featured on the listing. Everything is immaculate and I was beyond comfortable throughout my stay. The bed is great and I loved all of the natural light pouring into the entire space each morning. I was traveling alone so really appreciated the safety of the neighborhood and the security of the building. I didn't rent a car and was easily able to access public transportation within just a few minutes' walk. 

Favorite places for food and drink were the Navy Yard Bistro and the Warren Tavern, both of which were easy walks. The Bistro is very close. The Tavern was a bit of a longer walk but such a pleasant one and a great way to get a feel for Charlestown.  

Kristin's communication leading up to my stay was spot on. She responded quickly every time. I loved that this continued during my stay. All of my questions (""where are your dish towels?"") received a speedy response. 

Finally, I appreciated the thoughtful touches that speak to her going the extra mile, like s cup of change for me to use for the bus and  a loaded laundry card. I didn't do any laundry but those extra touches say a lot. 

I loved my experience and the location and wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. In fact, I wouldn't even bother looking elsewhere. ",1
"I did not see James during our stay, but he did have a great welcoming letter with everything we needed to know about the building! And What a perfect location. Great apartment with everything you need and plenty of space to just hangout if you want! This was my first time to Boston so I did not know one neighborhood from the next, but we were so close to everything! We took a uber to Cambridge from the apartment and it was under $15. The public transit is all really easy to get to from where  the apartment is. On a map everything looks like it is so far away but will be just a couple of miles, so if you are up for a nice walk in a beautiful city I recommend walking from place to place! Cafe Nero around the corner had great coffee, B&G Oyster bar is around the corner as well, and Blackbird donuts down the block, all worth stopping into! ",1
"Very good location. South End neighborhood is friendly, has good restaurants on every corner, and the architecture is beautiful.  James' apartment is confortable, and we enjoyed our time at his place.  We didn't meet him, but he let us a lot of useful informations in the apartment. ",1
"Very nice, great location! ",1
"What a great location! James approach and communication was timely, responsive and professional.  The neighborhood is wonderful and readily accessible to Boston, etc... The home was great, and we really had a good feel for living in the South End. Lots of area pamphlets and information is readily available in the home.  We had been in NY prior to coming to Boston, so the Washer/Dryer were extremely helpful.  Everything you need to cook and/or clean is available.  Kitchen appliances and bathroom plumbing are older, but in good working order and we had no problems.  Would absolutely stay here again.",1
"Overall a great stay at James' place! Can't beat the location and for the neighborhood, we were pleasantly surprised by the size of the fully stocked unit. James was very responsive via email and text and made every effort to make sure we had everything we needed. Check in/out was easy and James even accommodated our early arrival time. We would definitely stay here again!
",1
"The location was great.  Easy access to many tourist attractions and plenty of great restaurants down the street.  It's in historic south end Boston and thus property is older.  The furnishings are quite old and the shower in a bathtub with wrap around curtain takes some getting used to.  As long as can put up with some minor discomforts, a great deal in a great location.",1
We loved our stay here. It was in the mid nineties while we were there and the AC kept it nice and cool. Beautiful building and street.,1
"HoSt answered all texts in a timely fashion & provided important information.  Small kitchen appliances, filthy; shower curtain liner, moldy; bathroom floor, filthy; one headboard nearly detached from bed; dining table broken; couch , torn; food in fridge very very expired (i.e. soy sauce, 2008). ",1
"Carols and her family were very friendly and the description of the place matched the actual experience. Given how expensive housing is in Boston, this place offered quite the bargain. All the essentials were present, and the place is well-furnished. The location of the house is very convenient - no longer than a 10-minute walk from the train station, and a 15-minute ride to downtown Boston. The only thing for me is that the neighborhood gets a little quiet after dark, but for the price we paid this was again a bargain for a weekend's stay.",1
"The neighborhood was very quiet and residential but not far from a main road. The room was small but clean. The shared bathroom took getting used to but wasn't bad. Overall, I'd stay there again! ",1
"This place is in fact a hostel that Carols created in the basement of a house. Then, don't expect staying at Carols' place, and exchanging with her about Boston (we didn't see Carols, just her mother who opened us the door. She wes nevertheless very quick to answer the text messgaes). 
The kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom were clean. The bedroom was a little bit small, but with a TV (if you're interested in it) and wifi access. 
The main problem is that the ""hostel"" is located in the basement : it's quite dark and there is no windows, and no daylight coming.
We were also a little bit disappointed not to have towels (as it was said in the description).
The other big flaw is the sound-proofing : the walls are thin and we could hear all the converation coming from the neighbouring bedroom. 
The location is quite good : 15 min walk from the red line, then you have a train every 10 minutes and then you reach downtown in 20 min.
",1
"Carols was easy to communicate with before arrival and saw to it that we could get into the room although she was not at home. We hardly didn't see or talk to the family but they seem nice and friendly.
The room is in the basement with 4 other rooms and is rather small, basic and dark. No space to sit down or put your suitcases. The bed is good. The kitchen and bathroom are very basic to. They tried to do a good job by painting the bright colours but it stays a basic basement. It looks better on the pictures than it is. We didn't know they do not provide towels so we didn't bring any, but Carols gave us towels as an exeption.Positive thing is that you can sit outside in the back when the sun is shining and that there is only a 10 minutes walk to the subway.
Prices in Boston for accomodation are bery high so when you afe on a budget there is not much choice but do not expect much.",1
"It was such a great experience. Carols was a nice host. There is absolute privacy, nice and comfortable room. Everything was just on point. Carols is definitely being my host again the next time I visit Boston.",1
Nice trip close the city!,1
"Great, simple hostel-styled basement. Personal room with shared kitchen and bathroom among 4 rooms total I think. The walk to the train is about 10 minutes but that's not too bad. The neighborhood isn't the greatest, but it seems safe enough with lots of fast food and convenient stores nearby.",1
"Cool little room.  Nice host. Quiet place.
",1
Lovely place.. Really enjoyed my stay,1
We loved how they set up the downstairs living area and kitchen. Immediate reservation confirmation. Carols is quick to respond to texts. ,1
Very nice! Highly recommended!,1
"I really enjoyed stayed in her place. The place is very private, clean, and it's close to the train. I highly recommend her place ",1
We had a great 3 night stay at Carols place! The room was tiny but very lovely and clean. The neighborhood is save with some restaurants and stores right around the corner. It's only a 10 minutes walk to the Metro station. Carols was always very nice and helpful! We definitely would recommend this place to our friends for a trip to Boston!,1
"Me and my wife stayed in Carol's place for 4 nights. It is 10 min walk to metro station. with metro it takes 20 min to city centre. It was ok, transportation was fine. but the room was absolutely not a bright one. actually it is part of a renovated basement with 4 rooms and one bathroom. and our room had a very small window which was not even possible to open. the room was quite humid inside and smells humid. 
the bathroom was a shared one, we shared with some guys, who weren't flushing the toilet, which was not Carol's mistake. but it should be cleaned more often. 
there was also a kitchen which was not so clean and not fully equipped. there were some place out of the basement, fine and nice to have breakfast. 
Carol was not responding quickly before we arrived. we had to push her via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) to get some answers. During the stay she responded us and took care of our problems. 
To summarize, the room was like a cheap hostel room, for me, not in airbnb qualifications, where you feel like home. if you stay one or two nights, it's fine. for more nights, I do not recommend.",0
check in was smooth.. unfortunately never met the host.. room was clean and location was close to rail and bus connection..,1
"Our hosts were excellent, very friendly and helpful. 
Everything was comfortable and clean. Breakfast was delicious.
Home is located conveniently. There are buses nearby who can take you to the subway.
I would recommend staying there.
",1
The room and house was very nice and the hosts were wonderful and friendly. They helped us get oriented around Boston and showed us how to find the bus and metro. We even cooked together one day! It was a wonderful stay. ,1
I felt at home when staying at Cynthia's house.  Home-style traditional Jamaican breakfast I have tried for the first time is an unexpected experience.  Transportation provided by Cynthia's family member has made my trip exceptionally ecomic one since it allows me skipping the pricy parking cost and no need to even rent a car.  ,1
"Cynthia and her family are so welcoming and friendly, I really enjoyed my stay here!",1
What a nice house!  It is very clean and homey.  The private rooms have a deadbolt with a key to keep your belongings secure.  A wide variety of breakfast foods and drinks were available upon waking up.  There is a big yard with the cutest and friendliest dog you will ever meet.  Every member of the family that we met in our short time there was very nice and ready for conversation.,1
"I had a wonderful stay at Cynthia's home.  My bed was very comfortable.  And Cynthia and her family were incredibly friendly and hospitable.  They provided breakfast with a range of options each morning, which I thought was great.  ",1
"Staying at Cynthia's house was my first airbnb experience and it was fantastic. I drove into Boston late at night not knowing what to expect from the host and the house. As soon as I arrived, Cynthia's daughter, Bobelle, greeted me and helped me in. She was wonderful to me during my entire stay.  She helped me with directions (after I got lost) and saved a parking spot for me a couple of nights. My room was large, comfortable, and clean, and the house was quiet. Having breakfast and coffee with Cynthia in her beautiful kitchen was a very pleasant experience. Over the course of four days I was able to meet several family members. They all made me feel very welcome.  It truly felt like visiting with family. You’ll love it there.",1
Cynthia and Keith were very kind and generous hosts.  They accommodated my crazy schedule even though it meant me getting in a little late and getting up somewhat early.  Izzy the Pomeranian was ADORABLE!  :-),1
"Very nice host, sympatic atmosphere in Cynthia's house, there is always somebody in the house!
Declicious and complete breakfast !
It's a little bit far to downtown, but it's very easy to go there.

We spent good time here, thank you Cynthia!",1
"Cynthia and her family were extremely helpful, welcoming, and hospitable. Could not have asked for a better introduction to Boston. Transportation was convenient if you time the buses right. Thanks for having us!",1
Our trip turned out excellent thanks to Cynthia and her family! Great help with directions for transport! Excellent location and it felt like home!,1
It's eben a very nice stay. I would recommend this place this place any time. Cynthia is a very relaxed and friendly host. Many thanks!,1
"We'd a very nice stay at Cynthia's. The place was neat and clean. Cynthia and her family are very nice, she is a great cook and we got to taste some of her food which was very kind of her. ",1
Chynthia's house is friendly and clean!,1
"I had a very positive experience at cynthia and keith's. They are very kind ppl and catered to my every need. I hughly rec them.

Ron",1
"Cynthia and her family were very accommodating and kind.  She immediately showed us everything, made us feel welcome, and was able to answer all of our questions about getting around the city.  The room itself was nice and comfortable, and included a TV cable should we want to watch something.  ",1
"Cynthia was a great host and her friends and family are very welcoming!  She even offered to give us a ride to dinner the first night! She was very accomodating with our last minute (on Labor Day) reservation. The room is exactly as described, and I would definitely recommend her!",1
"The Room at Cynthias house was the perfect stay for our first nights in the USA during our trip.

We were new to the AirBnB thing and to the country itself, but Cynthia made sure we really felt like in our 'home away from home' (as she offered us).

The room was exactly like in the pictures and the possibility to arrange our late arrival in the evening was very helpful.

Either Cynthia or her husband Keith were available in the mornings to help us with the provided breakfast and give us tips for places to visit or just having a nice conversation.

So to sum it up: we recommend this place.",1
It was good experience. This room is comfortable. If you use 31 bus and subway the road to downtown take around 40 minutes. ,1
Perfect host!,1
"I really liked staying at this place. The family was very kind and welcoming. The house was clean. The room was spacious and the bed was very comfortable. You can get to downtown (MGH) with a bus+a train which took me about 50 minutes.... In general, I think it is worth the price.",1
"It was a really nicestay, Cynthia  and her family are really nice.",1
"Our stay at Cynthia's home was very nice. The house was clean, rooms very cozy and looked exactly as on the pictures. We enjoyed the company of all family members and would love to come back!",1
"Cynthia and Keith were excellent hosts, very responsive to our needs. The room was nice for the price. Breakfasts were enjoyable. The bus stop is nearby. They do keep a dog in a kennel in the kitchen, so if that bothers you (it didn't bother us) then don't book with her.",1
"Cynthia and her husband were incredible hosts!! I felt like I was back home. The space was very clean. Very welcoming. Truly helpful,kind, and caring. ",1
Thankyou for making us feel so welcome in your beautiful house. ,1
"we had a good stay with Cynthia. the room and shower were pretty clean and the lively family was very nice and welcoming. breakfast was pretty straight forwards but sufficient. 
the neighborhood is very quiet and residential. we felt we didn't want to stay outdoors too late at night there. it is also quite far from the main city. we had to take a bus to a train or two every time we wanted to venture out. we felt we spent a lot of our time on public transportation. it's about an hour to get to the center of Boston. 
but- there are a few Jamaican ""restaurants"" (fast and casual counters) walking distance from the house. we enjoyed the Jamaican patties very much.  ",1
Cynthia was greeting us even before we arrive and was extremely welcoming.,1
We loved to stay with her and her family. They are very kind. I got for sure new friends. Thank you.,1
Cynthia and her family are sweet hospitable people. Our stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The room was clean and had a private bath. Would stay there again and recommend it to others. Many thanks!,1
"Cynthia is a excellent host. Her home is busy, but I enjoyed all of the action (baby, pet, other guests, etc.). It is a very family centered environment. Mattapan is sort of a hike outside of the city, but the bus stop is literally less than a block away. The room I stayed in was very comfortable and clean and, again, Cynthia was very accommodating. I would definitely stay there again if the need arose.",1
"Everything was perfect and as described, the room is very comfortable and it has everything I need. The bathroom is also really big. Cynthia is very nice host and for sure will help you with everything you need. Very recommended.",1
I spent one more night at Cynthia's after getting back from Montreal. Nothing changed from what I wrote about my previous stay there :),1
"Cynthia and Keith are very nice hosts, super friendly and make sure the guests have everything they need. The room is big, clean and it looks exaclty as it looks on the pictures. They provided us with breakfast in the morning which is a very generous gesture which we appreciated a lot (bagels, fruits, coffee, tea, eggs, bacon). The small bathroom is shared with the whole family plus other guests but this was fine. I would recommend this place to other people, but it may not be the best one for people who like it ectremely clean because they do have pets which are definitely noticeable. ",0
"Me and my girlfriend stayed here a couple of days and in fact I don't think we could find a better place in Boston. The room is cozy, there is wifi and tv, and the house is less than 2km walk from Mattapan Station which connects you to the Boston subway system. Cynthia and her family are  very warm, welcoming people. It was a pleasure to be there.",1
"This was my first Airbnb stay and I'm really happy that I choose to stay with Cynthia and her family. They were very welcoming and helped me to find my way around Boston. Although the house is located a little bit outside the Boston downtown area, it has a good connection to public transport(bus and train). I also enjoyed the breakfast they offered. All in all I would  recommend staying there and if I ever come back to Boston, I would stay with Cynthia and Keith again! ",1
The place is nice and beautiful. Families and pet here create a comfortable sense and Cynthia is nice and will to communicate with us.,1
Cynthia and Keith are both really nice and welcoming and it is great to chat with them! They are also very helpful and happy to provide suggestions/information on the area. The room was homey with a comfortable bed and their house is really close to public transportation. We definately recommend a stay with Cynthia and Keith. Violetta and Thomas,1
"Thank you to Cynthia and her family for welcoming us into their home. We had a lovely experience. The room was great and the house was beautiful. We also had the added bonus if meeting the gorgeous Izzy, a very friendly dog. ",1
Another great airbnb experience. Cynthia has been very hospitable and even cooked lunch for my friend and I once! Good price and nice hosts. Love her dog:) ,1
Cynthia and her family were very friendly and made us feel welcome in their home. The listing was exactly as described with convenient access to the metro using the 31 bus. We really enjoyed our stay!,1
"Host was very accommodating, I had to check in late but she made it very easy. Host family was welcoming, the room was clean, spacious. Overall a very pleasant stay.",1
"Cinthya had a wonderful spacious Victorian house that is exacly as described, clean and comfortable. Cinthya  and Keith are verry friendly hosts and we had a delicious breakfast, and the communication was pleasant and informative. The house is in a quiet area and parking was no problem. Higly recommendable for Boston visitors. ",1
"Cynthia  and family are friendly and kind, specially when I arrived late her home she was waiting me,I appreciate that. Thanks you so much.",1
Enjoyed my stay. Host were friendly and the home was cozy.,1
"Cynthia and her family were lovely and made us feel very comfortable. They offer also a breakfast in the morning. The room and the bathroom correspond to the description. The neighborhood seems fine, and it is 25 mins from downtown Boston taking a bus and then the subway.  ",1
"Staying at Cynthias house was really nice for me and my friend. Cynthia wasn't there for the first two days, but her grandchild Misha was. She showed us some spots in the city and we had a lot of fun. Their pets are so cute! Our room was very clean and we even had our own TV and Wi-Fi there. Breakfast is served in the morning, which is also really good.
It can be a little hard to get there, especially if you're backpacking like us. But it is possible to go there via public transportation.",1
"We were part of the family. We felt very welcome. Breakfast is a social event.
Nice spacious room.
Enough parking space. The neighbourhood is far from downtown.",1
"Cynthia was awesome! Though we didn't really see much of her, she was clear and concise with instructions, and helpful too. She even lent us her bus/train pass so it was more convenient for us to travel around!:)",1
"love the friendly family soooooo much!The room is very clean,so is the shared bathroom,just like Im in my home in China.Cynthia and her daughter even cook for me and my friend,delicious breakfast,lovely kids,very precious experience for me for the first time using Airbnb ω ",1
"Cynthia is a very nice and helpful person. 
She made sure someone was there to welcome us after a long day of travel. She has a lovely house which is clean and familiar. Her house is 20 minutes away from downtown. We could use her kitchen any time. Cynthia made sure that we felt comfortable and had everything we needed. Her daughter always gave us good suggestions of places to go. 
And the best was: the breakfast every morning :) 
Thank you very much, for the nice time.",1
"My wife and I loved it here, Mrs. Cynthia was a great host.  Honestly, the room was big and comfortable like an upscale hotel.  Public Transportation was close by.  Would highly recommend!
",1
Cynthia was very responsible. I contacted her before checking in to see what we needed to do and she responded within a good time frame.  Room was clean and warm and her family members definitely made us feel at home.  ,1
"Cynthia and her family were extremely accommodating and friendly to us. They took care of our short stay in Boston. The location is great, just one block away from bus station and Boston transportation system doesn't disappoint. All in all, I had a great airbnb experience with Cynthia and family.",1
Nice comfortable room. Bed was perfect for me. Everything is very organized! They were kind enough to let me stay one night only.,1
"Everything was awesome. We felt like home, staying there. Cynthia and her family were so nice and kind to us. We learned so fast how to get to downtown and it was only 25 min. to get there.",1
The place is okay for budget travel & short-term stay.,1
Cynthia and her whole family were very welcoming.  My daughter and I felt ourselves at home.  Cynthia went above and beyond to help us navigate Boston.  I wish her and her family well.,1
The host is very accommodating in terms of the schedule of checking in. Keep in good communication. Very helpful by arranging pick up at the bus stop. The room is spacious.,1
"I loved staying with Cynthia and Keith. They are both wonderful kind people, and the room was perfect. I recommend this Air B and B to anyone! I would stay here again in a heart beat. Thanks again for a great stay in Boston! ",1
"My visit was quick, just a night, but the room was just what we needed. Comfy firm bed, clean sheets and towels, and a great shower! The family was welcoming but not obtrusive. Cynthia was welcoming and generous. ",1
"Stayed for 4 days at this residence in Dorchester. About 40 mins to get downtown in all (walk + bus + train). Parking easily available outside. The room was spacious and had a good view + clean. Bed was comfortable, bathroom was clean. Did have some bathroom issues as only 1 bathroom shared with a family of 3 people + 2 guest bedrooms. Me and my companion woke up early each morning to avoid these bathroom issues, but the last day we were a bit delayed as the second guest bedroom was rented . Other than that was a delight staying with the family, its dog and rarely visible cat.",1
"Overall great experience. Very comfortable and clean room, very good food in the morning, and very kind and welcoming hosts. I'd definitely stay here again.",1
"First of all I want to mention that Cynthia is a very nice and welcoming person and we enjoyed her presence. 
We were a bit disappointed that the room didn't quite look like it was presented in the pictures on the site, though maybe our expectations were a bit high. The bathroom could have been cleaner. 
Overall it was ok, but we have to rate it as average because we had better accommodation during our US trip. ",0
"The host had been very welcoming, the room was clean, the sheets were too (very important). There was A/C and wifi. No problem with having our privacy. The house is in a Jamaican neighborhood, it had been a bit of culture shock but we felt at home really quickly and we're happy to learn more about the culture and the food. Great experience, we would book with her again !
",1
"Cynthia met us very late to let us in and was very welcoming and accommodating. The house and room was clean and pleasant. Unfortunately we stayed on a Saturday night and the noise from the street was very loud as various neighbors were partying. The Windows are thin and if you are a light sleeper this place might be difficult on a weekend. Also, the walls are thin and you can hear if people are walking around outside the room which is another difficulty for light sleepers. We ended up not getting any sleep because we are both light sleepers and decided to stay somewhere else the next night. A lovely and clean home over all with kind hosts though.",1
It was a very comfortable home and vwry beautiful.  The riom was perfect and just what we needed for the night.  Everyone in the home was super nice and helpful.,1
"Cynthia was great! She was very helpful in giving us ways to get to and around the city as first timers! Our room was nice and clean too! Her home is located a few miles away from the city, but it is so quick and easy to get there via bus, train, or car. Overall, she was an awesome host and her home is a decent place to stay for a couple of nights.",1
"The host hasnt been there as said via mail before. When we arrived another couple was waiting for the closed door. After 45 Minutes her son arrived, but didnt let us in. After a while and a call with his Mum, we could enter. We asked to cook Pasta Because we were very hungry, he didnt allow. We had to wait until his mom came. She was at least Friendly. The Room was okay, tv doesnt work. Bath not that Expected clean. Loud Family. For one short Night okay. ",0
"Cynthia and her family were so nice w me and my BF, they waited for us until 4am to do check in , we felt free in her house! By car is 20 min to Boston, and on Saturday get neighbors were throwing a party, we could hear from the room but it was hit a issue for us! ",1
"Very nice and clean room, Cynthia and her family are awesome, open minded and advisor ! 

We will not hesitate to come again if we have the opportunity !",1
"I went to Boston with my wife and my 7-month old son. The apartment was very nice, good located, Anne was quite helpful; and the whole experience is highly recommended.  ",1
"The location was perfect--right next to a T stop and about 10 to 15 minutes from anywhere we wanted to go. The apartment was in a very nice building.  The apartment itself was fine, though directions for connecting to the internet would've been helpful.  The apartment was clean, though dusty.  We ended up having to change the sheets as they were not clean, fresh linens.  There also wasn't any toilet paper, paper towels, or coffee filters so we had to get our own. Anne was very kind and helpful, though.  I would definitely recommend staying here or in another one of her properties.  I would certainly stay at one of her properties the next time I'm in Boston.",1
"Wow, Anne offers a nice Apartement near the Town Hall and is very helpful with everything. We had a very good time and would visit again for sure. Thank you again, Anne. ;O)",1
"We had an enjoyable stay. The location was perfect. The place was comfortable, although a hair dryer in the apartment would be helpful. We did not have the best return communication from Anne prior to our arrival, however, she was very pleasant and helpful in person. We would not hesitate to stay here in the future, and we have already recommended it to friends.",1
"A bit of a pain getting access but the place is nice enough, in a great area and the building itself is very nice",1
Great location and very helpful host. Everything I needed was in the apartment. Warm inside on the cold days. Very reasonable rates as well. Much more homely than a hotel room. This will be my first choice next time I come to Boston.,1
"The Apartment was great. Perfect location, 2 mins from Boston Common. Everything you need for your stay is in the apartment and it is close to all amenities. Easy access to and from airport and around Boston on T. Cheaper than a hotel and a lot more private. Would not hesitate to stay here again",1
"The appartment was real value for (URL HIDDEN) was centrally located and provided easy access to Boston's attractions.the apartment itself was cosy and comfortable.Due to location there is trouble with parking and the nearby parking places are quite expensive.However the parking in Boston common had more reasonable prices.Overall we enjoyed our stay in the bright one bedroom on Beacon st. Anne was a very helpful host ,accessible and provided us with all info necessary.She was friendly and helpful.Iwould recomend her as a host.",1
"My stay was very good.

Anne is very helpful and readily available.

The apartment has old furniture but is very comfortable and quiet. Heating works like a charm. Bathroom is spacious and the kitchen has all you'll need.
The bed sofa can accomodate two people. If you plan on having visitors note there aren't doors between the livingroom and the bedroom (there's a corridor) and the bathroom door opens to the bedroom.
Wi-fi works fine and with good bandwith.

The location is simply the best. Being a young adult, It's a 2 minute walk to Park station, 5 min to State and Downtown Crossing (and that should cover all T lines). It's a 15 min walk to the MGH hospital complex or the shopping area at Boylston/Newbury street. Boston University, Beth Israel, Harvard square are 30 min away by T line. You're on top of the hill which isn't too steep to walk around. There's lots of pubs, fast food and restaurants. There's a very helpful conveniency store with ATM machine on the building next door.

If you're planning on visiting Boston for tourism you might not even need public transportation to see 80% of the city's points of interest. If you come to work, you'll get most places fast. The Beacon Hill neighborhood is a lovely and safe location to just stroll around.

Taxi cost me around 25$ from the airport to the apartment sunday night. If you bring luggage from the silver line note that Park street station does not have elevators.

Definitely would come back.",1
Our stay at Anne's place was great. Anne was very professional and easy to communicate with. The apartment had everything we needed plus an amazing view of Boston from the rooftop deck. The location is perfect. We would definitely book again. ,1
Just loved it! Thanks!,1
"This apartment in Boston was prefect for me.  I was in town for a month for work and had my wife visiting so I wanted a place with more than a hotel could provide.

This apartment has an amazing view of the Golden Dome from the living room. The kitchen is small but adequate.  The bedroom is big and full of light.  The mattress and pillows are old and need replacing. The bathroom is big with minimal to no counter space and low water pressure but not terrible.  

I was in Boston in July. It was hot.  There is one widow AC in the living room which cools nicely but as the bedroom is down a long hallway it stayed a pretty warm temp. So, I asked for a fan to get some of the cool air from the AC down to the bedroom.  Anne provided one the next day. I like it cool/cold when I sleep and the fan was perfectly adequate to make me comfortable sleeping. I suggest getting a 2nd AC for the bedroom however the fan worked just fine.

Anne was extremely accommodating.  To the extent of not only getting a fan, but getting a new TV for me when I mentioned I travel with an AppleTV and the existing TV didn't have an HDMI port.  I came home the next evening and she had replaced the TV with a newer one that had the necessary inputs!

The Building is beautiful with a doorman and rooftop deck over looking the Golden Dome and Commons in an amazing area.  Just beautiful. I had a great time.

I highly recommend this listing.",1
"The place was great and as described in the listing. Anne was excellent, quickly responsive to any communications,  and a pleasure to work with. I will do business with her again next time.",1
"This is a lovely apartment, and Anne is a great host. She has just the right mix of attention and non-interference. We never saw her, but replies to text messages came almost instantly. Everything was where it should be (from the keys to the coffee filters), and the place was very clean. The location is convenient and the building is lovely. The kitchen is well-equipped but a little cramped, but then most people on holiday will probably not be eating in much.

We know where we will be staying when we come back to Boston! ",1
"Had a great stay. Apartment was very convenient, centrally located, had everything we needed and a very nice space for the cost. Would definitely stay again. ",1
"Nice and clean apartment, very centrally located.  Booked the apartment really late but Anne was very kind to accommodate all my needs.   ",1
"Best location in Boston. Incredibly convenient. The view of the gold dome from the window was spectacular. Didn't have any problems, so we never needed to contact Anne during our stay. Prior to coming, Anne was very helpful and responsive. ",1
"Anne was very responsive and very helpful! The location of the apartment can't be beat. The only caveat is that the bed is uncomfortable. There is only one a/c unit, which worried me, but with the aid of a box fan, the whole apartment cooled down quickly. Thanks, Anne!",1
"The apartment  was clean and move in ready!  The kitchen was great, it allowed us to cook for ourselves and not eat out everyday. Whole foods is right around the corner.",1
"Great host, great apartment and an even better location. Couldn't recommend this apartment enough. Very spacious apartment within walking distance of all the sights",1
Great location and amazing host ... thanks!! Very welcoming and look forward to coming back soon.,1
I stayed for 2 nights at a great 1 bedroom w/ a loft. The location could not have been more perfect. The place had everything you would need. My host Jesse was very courteous with my check in and check out. I look forward to Returning to Boston and staying in this great location. ,1
"Jesse's apartment has an unbeatable location. We were within walking distance of almost everything in Boston including the Public Garden, Downtown Crossing, Boston Commons, Newbury Street and much more. As for the apartment itself, it's small so it's good for 2-3 people, more than that it will be too crammed. One of the downsides, there was no place for us to put our clothes all the ,closets were full. The kitchen is not fully stocked; so you have to go food shopping as soon as you get here. The Wifi is excellent, very fast. The bathroom is small; the tub wasn't very clean, towels weren't plentiful so I suggest bringing extras. Other than that everything was good, and we had a good stay.
Sent from my iPhone",0
"Jesse was a wonderful host, very responsive, and accommodating. The location is unbeatable, and he was kind enough to have a list of things to do while in the city. I would absolutely book with Jesse again and recommend this location to anyone staying in the Boston area. ",1
Jesse is really a good host. And the house is perfect. ,1
The location could not be beat for marathon week-end. There was plenty of bottled water for our runner :)   Jesse went out of his way to make sure we would have enough bedding for the four of us. It was a tad small for four people but it certainly worked. Jesse was very accommodating regarding check-in and check-out. We would stay there again if we were to visit Boston again. ,1
"Clean room, clean sheets, clean towels, toiletries. Wifi was provided, overall had a decent experience.",1
"Jesse is a fantastic host. From our first communication to checking out, he went out of his way to be friendly and helpful. He provides a great list of recommendations to local restaurants and sights in the area. The apartment itself is located on one of the most beautiful streets in Boston, and overall made for a very comfortable and restful stay. When I'm back in Boston, I hope Jesse's place will be available so I can stay again-one of my best Airbnb experiences yet!",1
"The loft was spacious, my family had a great stay. Would recommend 5/5.",1
"Had a wonderful few days in Boston at Jesse's Back Bay studio.  It is as cute as pictured and in a fantastic location.  We literally walked EVERYWHERE we wanted to go no problem - the riverfront, Newbury St, the Provincial Tower, Public Library, Faneuil Hall (and I know I spelled that wrong - sorry!), Public Garden, Commons, to the harbor for a cruise, North End/Little Italy... it was great!!  Apt is clean, cute, comfy, nice kitchen, couple interesting books, TV (which we never watched - too many other things to do!), plenty of room for two.  Jesse was nice, met us on the front steps, left us some touring info... nice host.  Would definitely stay here again.",1
"My folks from the west coast were visiting me in NY, so we planned a night in Boston, as they had never been before.  This place is AWESOME! The location is amazing,  lots of food options, bars, coffee shops, and everything else you can think of.  Commonwealth Ave is gorgeous, and all of Boston is pretty much walking distance from this place.  The place itself is super cool.  Old, but super well kept building with lots of character.  Jesse was great as well.  I got in a little late but he was able to meet with me and my folks at the door step, gave us a 5 minute tour of the place, handed a handy sheet with all kinda of things to do,  places to eat, etc and then he was on his way.  Great host.",1
Great location and great place. The place was within walking distance to Feenway Park!. Jesse was very accommodating and flexible with our arrivals and departures. I would definitely stay here again. ,1
"A fantastic central location, and a great way to live like a local. Jesse was great to work with and I would definitly rent here again.",1
"This was a great stay in Boston! The location is excellent, the place is very comfortable, and the interaction with Jesse, the host, was very straightforward. Jesse was very flexible about my check in time and met me to show me the place and give me information upon my arrival. Everything was clean and ready to go. When needed, Jesse was quick to reply and give me information as needed. Checkout was a breeze. Would happily stay here again. ",1
"Great location and a very charming building. The place is cozy, but was perfect for me, my wife and teenage daughter. Quiet at night and close walking distance to lots of dining, shopping and entertainment in Boston. Bed was a little uncomfortable for me and my wife, but wouldn't stop us from staying here again. Host Jesse was a great communicator and flexible with check in and out. Recommend!",1
Jesse was gracious and very approachable. He gave us great direction of the area with a list of places to go and things to do. Really enjoyed meeting him!,1
"Jesse's apartment was a great place to be for our few days in Boston. It was in a very convenient location and had everything we needed. Its view of the park was very pleasant, and it was great to be near the action on Boylston and Newbury Streets. We had a great time there!",1
"This is absolutely the best location in Boston. I wanted to show my kids what it's like to live in Boston and thanks to Jesse's bnb I did.
Jesse wa super nice and accommodating in terms of check in and check out.
I was worried abt my morning coffee so he went an bought extra nespresso pods.
The place is cute and full of character. My kids loved the loft. He has board games , books and an Apple TV was a big plus. You can watch pretty much anything you want if you have an apple product that connects to internet. 
The kitchen was full of pleasant surprises , coconut oil , couscous ... Yum
Jesse said he vacuumed before we came . That's the only thing I can think of which he can improve upon.
He cleaned like a typical guy, not like a cleaning lady. 
Mattress and bedding was average but again at home I've splurged on memory foam so I shouldn't compare !",1
"The room is perfect! We liked it a lot. Jesse always responded in time and helped us to fixed the wifi. In the room, there are coffee and beer and was really helpful when we just arrived. We should fill in some coffe and bear for the newcomer, although we stayed too little time and left too early. Sorry for that. Jesse left us a list with best restaurants we could try. Thanks a lot. Hopefully we didn't damage anything in that lovely room.",1
"The location of Jessie’s house is very good, and we basically walked to everywhere in our 4 days of stay in Boston, and the metro transportation is also very convenient. The couch and bed are comfortable and I’ll recommend this place to my friends. ",1
"My wife and 7 year old son stayed in Jesse's and it was perfect.  My son especially like that he got to sleep in the loft.  The location was great.  It was very convenient to many restaurants, the ""T"" and within walking distance of many sights.  We would definitely recommend the place and would stay there again.",1
Jesse was a great host and the apartment was situated in a perfect location.,1
"Paige is very responsible for all details. The apt is located in back bay area, very convenient to metro and taxi taking. The place is clean and nice. It is a good choice for staying in Boston.",1
"Paige's place was great. The location is on beautiful Commonwealth Avenue, which has a nice park through the middle that leads you to the Boston gardens. Perfect for walking a dog or just getting some excercise. Shopping and restaurants are only a few blocks away. Fenway park is close by and there is a stop for the hop-on hop-off trolley that will take you on a tour of the whole city.",1
"Stay at this place. It's a great location for walking or taking the T anywhere you need to go in Boston. Great neighborhood, the apartment is very spacious/clean, and the host is extremely responsive/friendly and we got a deal for staying at her place. Couldn't have had a better experience! ",1
Paige was very easy to get in contact with via text message. The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our stay. ,1
"This apartment has a perfect location. Only a block and half away from the T and steps away from Newberry St., which has plenty of restaurants, galleries, and shops. The apartment has two rooms plus a bathroom and the kitchen is fully stocked; both beds are also comfortable. Paige was a fantastic host and always responded immediately if we needed anything.",1
"It was perfect!! Such a cute and homely apartment! It's in a perfect location, easy to get around to some great places in back bay. Great communication from Paige and it was nice to have a fully set up kitchen so we could have some nice meals in too. Would definitely stay again!! ",1
"We had a great time at this location! It was perfectly located near Fenway Park and so many awesome restaurants and bars. My Favorites were Mei Mei Street Kitchen, Hojoko, Eastern Standard and so many more. I would love to return one day!",1
"The location was fantastic, in a cute building on a beautiful block, and close to Newbury Street, the T station, and great places to eat. Paige was extremely responsive and provided us with everything we needed. Check in and check out were fast and easy. This Airbnb really made our weekend in Boston amazing :) ",1
the apartment was exactly as presented in the profile... Paige was very responsive and made sure we had everything we needed... location was great for walking and very inviting... 5 stars!,1
"This is a review for 384 Commonwealth 42, Boston, MA. 
     Unfortunately, we did not have a good experience. We arrived at the apartment around 6PM, after a long day of traveling. The main problem was the extreme heat coming from the old style wall unit heaters in each of the rooms. There is no thermostat control in the apartment to regulate the heat. When we tried to plug in the air conditioning unit in the bedroom, the wall outlet started to spark because the cord was frayed. We had no choice but to open the windows and cool off the apartment. The building is on a very busy main street, so between the traffic and parties, it was pretty loud. 
     This is an old somewhat run down building. While it's decorated very nicely, the pictures don't represent the old condition of the apartment. Also, the TV didn't work, the main room heating unit was leaking and there was significant dry rot on the floor, the bathroom sink hot water spigot didn't work, and there was a lot of peeling paint. 
     We tried to contact Paige by email, phone, and text from 6-9PM, but there was no response. We finally heard back from her by text at 4:15am. 
      By this point we were exhausted, and decided we couldn't stay for the second night. We texted Paige to tell her we were leaving before her 11AM checkout time. We walked a few doors down to the Eliot Hotel, and they were nice enough to let us check in early. 
     We asked for a $200 refund from Paige, but she said she never gives refunds for any reason. We submitted a resolution request through Airbnb, and because of our pictures and explanations, they agreed to refund the $200 since Paige would not. They also gave us $60 towards a future Airbnb booking. We have had great experiences with our last 2 Boston Airbnb rentals, and we will absolutely use Airbnb again. But I cannot recommend Paige or this apartment.

"Good place for two people, great location to central Boston areas. 

And owner was very responsive. 
",1
"Great location, easy walk to shops, parks, bars. Very responsive! ",1
"While I didn't meet Paige, she was lovely to speak to and check in/out was a breeze.  The location of the apartment is fantastic! Close to Fenway Park and only a block away from Newbury Street and shops!  The apartment was clean and as described/shown in pictures!  Loved our stay in this apartment!",1
"we lived in 384 commonwealth avenue 42, where is great location,5-10mins walking to Newbury St. There are a lot of nice restaurants, stores and bars nearby.  It is really convenience for tourists living here. Due to cleaning lady’s careless, they forget to clean our apartment when we arrived. That was really disappointing. We contacted Paige, she quickly responded us and sent a cleaning lady to clean the apartment.  My friends and I read the instructions and followed what it tells us, but we still cannot find additional sheets, towels. The apartment should give more instructions for future Airbnbers about these, or just putting on the bed. Anyway, Paige is a kind and helpful host, very patient answer all of our questions.",0
"Although we had good communication from Paige before we arrived in Boston for our trip and she did allow us to drop our bags early since check-in time wasn't until 3, I can't say we had a pleasant stay.  When we arrived to check in the apartment at 3 it was extremely hot since it was almost 90 degrees that day.  After trying to plug in the air conditioner it was apparent it wasn't working.  I contacted Paige to ask her about the air conditioner.  She stated that her assistant dropped off a new one and they were installing them in June, but for us to feel free to put it in the window and replace the old one ourselves.  WHAT?!?!  I was so shocked by her response.  I stated that that is not something WE should be doing.  Then she stated that she could come by help us install it in the morning because ""they are super light and easy"".  Obviously she knew there was an issue with the air conditioner before we arrived...why was it not fixed/installed beforehand?  The new one is sitting in the bedroom.  Not only is it unprofessional, but it is an extreme liability to ask your guests to remove an old air conditioner and install a new one.  Again I was appalled and upset by Paige's response. I knew there was nothing she was going to do to resolve the situation and just told her we didn't know if we would be there in the morning and I just had to deal with the heat for the next 3 days.  Even with the windows open it was still hot and stifling.  After that initial communication from Paige the day we arrived....nothing.  The apartment is not in as good a condition as the pictures here, but it is in a great location (the one good thing I can say about it).  This was our first time using Airbnb, but I've heard wonderful things from friends about their stays/experiences so I hope to try it again and have a better experience.  We've been to Boston a number of times and love it.  We will be visiting Boston again, but will not be using Paige.  I don't normally post a negative response but couldn't in good conscience let others know about our experience so they knew what to expect.",0
"Paige was an amazing host! All of the instructions were clear and concise, and we had everything we needed. The location of the apartment was top-notch too. All in all, a great stay in a great city :) ",1

The neighborhood is GREAT!!!!!!! One of the most beautiful streets in Boston. We had a great time!!!!",1
"Paige's place was perfect for our Boston visit. Great location (short walk to Fenway, Newbury Street and to our conference hotel). Cute apartment: clean, quiet, comfortable bed and fold-out couch with nice sheets, good towels (and two towels per-person - appreciated!), and a well-equipped kitchen. Clear instructions, both in text sent prior to our visit and instructions in the apartment. We were glad we'd brought a small fan for the main room, based on comments from other people who'd stayed - indoor temperature was very comfortable with fan, even with warm weather. ",1

"Glenn's home is great! It's a wonderful space that is kept very clean. It's in a great location, with walking distance throughout Boston. Booking with Glenn was very easy. He responded promptly and with a bunch of details, so we felt very comfortable. I would recommend staying at his home to any of my family and/or friends. ",1
"This 2-bedroom apartment was quite spacious and definitely enough for me and 4 of my friends. The high ceilings made the space seem even more spacious, so place is actually bigger than it seems in the pictures. The place was well-decorated and had everything that we needed (i.e. towels, sheets, dining ware, etc.). The closest T stops are about a 10-minute walk away. The neighborhood is quiet as there are many families who live in the area, and there are a number of great restaurants nearby. I'd definitely recommend this place for a visit to Boston. ",1
"The apartment is great, clean, location is perfect, very nice neighborhood, check-in was very easy and worked out perfect ( we were later then first noted), easy access to downtown Boston. Recomended ",1
Everything was great and easy!!,1
"This apartment was so beautiful. My guests and I were in awe of the classic beauty. The very high ceilings and large windows were a breath of fresh air. The place was impeccably clean, with ample towels, sheets, and a kitchen fully stocked so we were able to prepare our food. Also, it is in a beautiful area with everything you could think of or need within walking distance. I definitely would like to rent this place again. Thanks!",1

"Kevin was there to greet us, and available on the phone when needed.",1
Never actually got to stay here but looked like a lovely place. ,1
This place is very spacious and everything is great ! It is located at a quiet and nice neighborhood with lots of good restaurant. There are some meter parking available on the street. Very happy with the entire experience and much thanks to Kevin who showed us the place. ,1

"Nice place, quiet neighborhood, easy to rent from.",1
"Completely hassle free, this reservation and stay was A+! Glenn went out of his way to be flexible for our stay accommodations. The space itself had more than what we needed- spare blankets, pillows, toilet paper, even peanut butter! :) 
Very highly recommended! ",1
Fantastic apartment. Everything went smoothly. Great area. Would suggest this location. To anyone traveling to the Boston area. I will certainly be trying to stay there again. ,1
"What a terrific surprise this stay was! In town for a convention at the Hynes, we chose to spend the night at this beautiful unit rather than the hotels in the area. Great price, far more comfortable than any hotel room would have been and a very short walk from the convention center. Perfectly clean and prepared for our arrival. We will definitely repeat this the next time we need a place to stay.",1
"It was a last minute trip. Glenn was very good helping us check in late. Apartment was great, had plenty of everything you would expect from upscale hotel and more. Keep in mind it's a very old building, but apartment is in excellent condition. Great area, nice restaurants for breakfast, lunch and dinner within walking distance.  Parking is tough, but very easy to get uber. Overall very good experience, loved Boston. Staying in this apartment definitely adds to Boston experience.",1
"Glenn was very easy to communicate with and promptly responded to my emails and texts. He also worked with us when we had a change in plans for getting the keys. The place was in a great neighborhood and I felt safe. There are plenty of restaurants and bars within a ten minute walk in almost any direction. If you are looking for great breakfast sandwiches, take a nice 15 minute walk to Mike and Patty's. The apartment had nice upgraded features, with plenty of utensils and pots/pans to make meals. All of the beds were very comfortable. It was clean and cozy. The cross street has one side of 2 hr visitor parking M-F 8am - 6pm, so we were able to save some money over the weekend. I would stay here again and would recommend to my friends. ",1
Glenn has a wonderful place and made us feel at home. Highly recommend it. ,1
"My first Airbnb and Boston experience could not have gone any better thanks to Glenn. The place was beautiful, it was in one of the best locations in all of Boston, it was very easy to get to anywhere in and around the city. Glenn gave me plenty advice on what and where to do things throughout the duration of my trip. A+ experience all around. Thank You Glenn!",1
"Kevin was there to greet us and show us the ins and outs of the house and was very welcoming! The brownstone was so quaint and beautiful- we often came back early just to lounge around the house, it had a comfortable atmosphere. Very clean, neat, and organized. We only stayed for the weekend. The beds were big and comfy, and the couch pulls out into a bed as well. Thanks for a great stay!",1
"Great location, lovely place. Very helpful host. No problems ",1
"Great apartment, really perfect.  Very clean, spacious, incredibly comfortable beds.  Kitchen well supplied, though we didn't end up using it, lots of excellent restaurants nearby.  This was ideal for us, location is right in the heart of the South End where we wanted to be.  Feels very safe, you can walk everywhere.  Easy key pick up, and we just left them in the apartment at departure.",1
"The host made arrival painless.  We arrived during the 2nd quarter of the Super Bowl and were let in immediately upon arrival.  Aside from it being an absolutely beautiful apartment, the location was also perfect for us.  ",1
"Glenn's apartment is perfect! 
During our trip to Boston, we stayed in Glenn's place as a party of four. It was roomy, well equipped, very clean   and definitely large enough for all four of us. The building is charming and very typical of the south E scene. We found the location very convenient to get to anywhere in Boston. 

Kevin, a friend of Glenn, met us upon arrival and was very kind to stay and point out his favourite spots in the local area. Communication was always clear throughout the stay. 

If you're ever in Boston we highly recommend staying here. Thanks Glenn.  ",1
"Glen has an excellent apartment. My friends and I rented it out for a reunion and had a great time. It is well appointment, spacious, cleanly,  and in a great location. We would certainly stay here again. I highly recommend it. ",1
"This apartment was amazing! My friends and I stayed for three days and two nights. The beds were comfortable and the living area was very spacious. Great restaurants all around the apartment. We met up with Kevin, who let us into the apartment and worked with us on check in and check out. Highly recommended! ",1
Lovely flat in excellent location. We particularly enjoyed the Appleton cafe on Dartmouth Street. Kevin came to meet us reliably and Glenn responded to our queries. ,1
"Loved our stay in unit #3.  Four of us stayed in this unit.  It was spacious, clean and had very comfortable beds.  We had everything we needed for our stay and Kevin who met us at the unit, made us feel right at home.  I would definitely stay here again.  Great home and great location in Boston.",1
"place was as described. Glenn was very helpful
with our move in; definitely would return ",1
"We had a wonderful stay at #3 670 Tremont. Prior to our stay Glenn and Kevin gave us tips on where to park, which was most useful. Upon arrival we were greeted by Kevin who have us a great run through of everything we needed to know. He also had a pack and play there for my 1 year old, which was great. The place was well equipped and even had tea/coffee etc. The towels were lovely and soft and the place was nice and clean with lovely big rooms with high ceilings. The location was perfect, all the main attractions of the city were walkable. There is also a Starbucks and a mini supermarket within a few minutes walk. Would definitely stay here again and would recommend to anyone visiting Boston.",1
"Towels were fluffy, white and lots of them, location was exactly what we needed, felt comfortable as a woman to walk to shops, cafes, Starbucks and to Malls, air conditioning in bedrooms was better than expected - very comfortable. Having three sets of keys was very convenient.",1
"The listing was accurate, and both Glenn and Kevin were very helpful. The apartment was spic and span, and the beds were very comfortable. The location was also great. The only thing I'd suggest is that it's made clear that, because it's on the first floor, there is noise from the apartment(s) overhead, so it might not work for people looking for more peaceful accommodations. That said, it is in an apartment building (not a private home) so knowing that one can always come prepared with earplugs!",1
The place was extremely well kept and spacious with easy access to everything in Boston.  We were able to get to the apt very easily with a gracious host.  ,1
"We were welcomed by Vivian who was waiting for us when we arrived. The apartment was very comfortable, the KS bed we slept in was probably the best bed we've ever slept in. We cooked a simple pasta dish that night & the kitchen is well stocked. Location was very handy as a base from which to explore Boston. We enjoyed our 3 night stay very much",1
"The place was exactly as it is described in the pictures.  The area was great! We walked home from MIT graduation, we walked to the Prudential Center and environs...that's how close it is to everything! Five of us fitted comfortably in the apt. Everything was great. We didn't get to meet Glenn but met Kevin who was just as pleasant. Highly recommended...hoping to come back in a few months!",1
Great location.  Easy contact.  Really enjoyable place.  Would definitely choose this place again and recommend to others.,1
"Glenn is very organized, and his building manager Kevin was most helpful. The apartment is pleasant, clean and comfortable.  All in all a good choice, decently located. ",1
"Our stay at Glenn's place was great. The building manager Kevin agreed to meet us early when our flight got in and was very helpful, and the apartment is in a great location and was very comfortable for 4 people.",1
We had a fantastic experience at the apartment.  It was exactly what I expected it to be.  Communication was fantastic between ourselves and the host.  The neighborhood is within walking distance to many parts of Boston.  Our family loved it.,1
Glenn was not available but he had someone waiting for us on our arrival.  She gave us a tour and told us everything we needed to know.  She was very pleasant and helpful.,1

Great location in downtown Boston and historical brownstone home. Great communications from the Glenn and Kevin. Everything as expected. ,1
"This home was beautiful, spacious, tidy, and equipped for the 7 (4 seniors and 3 adults) of us who were in Boston to attend a family wedding. It was located in a very convenient and central area with lots of delightful restaurants and cafes within walking distance.  Our hosts did note the inconvenience of finding day and overnight parking for our cars ahead of time.  Parking was definitely a big issue for us.  While the last minute addition of our aunt required us to pay an extra fee, we weren't too fussed since we did change from 6 to 7 guests in the last minute and paid.  Exchanging keys was smooth and Kevin was helpful in providing all the necessary information about the apartment and neighbourhood.  Thanks for a wonderful stay! I would definitely recommend this home for others visiting  B-town!",1
Very charming .Very nice neighborhood.,1
"Jens place was a great find! It was close to everything in southie, we loved it. Her place was convenient and inviting. Lots of space! Parking was a bit confusing at first, but other than that id definitely recommend! Jen suggested some great places to check out! Super friendly and inviting! ",1

"Jennifer was a great host.  Being new to Airbnb, she helped me through the process and was always quick to answer questions.  She recommended great places nearby to eat and shop.  Spacious apartment with great furniture.  I recommend staying here. ",1
Jennifer was really friendly and accommodating. We had to change the times of our arrival and departure and she made things very easy. ,1
Afsoon was so quick to respond it was great. The place was a perfect location for access to Fenway and had some awesome food and shopping options within blocks. The whole process was simple and lovely,1
"Afsoon was very good at communicating prior to the trip, however we went out of our way to accommodate her because she was not there in person to deliver the keys. The apartment was ready for us, but was less than could be desired. Perhaps we expected too much, but it was average for our stay in Boston. In the future we would probably spend more for a nicer place. ",1
"Kristen welcomed us into her condo and was such a warm and gracious host.  She made herself very available to answer any questions we had about her place amd offered recommendations in the area.  The condo was SO CLEAN (thank you!!), she set us up with everything we could need for a weekend in Boston.  Such a beautiful apartment in a brand new building, awesome ""up-and-coming"" area, minutes to the Freedom Trail and Bunker Hill, and a spectacular host!",1
"Kristen greeted me personally in her lovely apartment at the Navy Yard. The place is nicely decorated, has a beautiful kitchen with all the necessary goodies, and the sleeping area and living room are well separated. For anyone staying for a short period at the MGH facilities this is great. It took me 2 minuted to get to my appointments!",1
"I was in Boston for an activity at MGH-IHP, Kristen's apartment is perfect: Conveniently located, super clean and very comfortable.  The checking in and check out was super easy. I would definitely like to stay there again in the future. ",1
Great place and great location! It was easy checking in and out. Definitely recommend as a cool way to experience Boston. ,1
Kristen's place was awesome. It was super clean and in a very quiet neighborhood. And just a short walk to North Station we could get anywhere in the city. Kristen was also very welcoming and communicative.  10/10 ,1
"We had a great few days here. The apartment is lovely and comfortable! There are a ton of historical sites around the area, but not many restaurants or cafes. However it's not a far walk (15-20 mins) to some really nice places in Charlestown. We would definitely stay again. ",1
"Kristen's place was very clean, cozy... and great location! I felt right at home and loved the neighborhood. I went on runs each morning by the pier... something I wouldn't have wanted to do if it weren't for the great views/location. Recommend to all! 

She was also a great host and very quick to respond by text/call when any questions came up. Thank you!",1

We really enjoyed our stay here and hope to return sometime.",1
"Terry is a very welcoming host and couldn't be more helpful.
The accommodation is great. The furnishings really make you feel like you're at home. We are a family of 4 and there was plenty of room. The building has lots of character, and the neighbours are nice and friendly.
The location is safe, quiet and very pleasant. It's a very short walk to the bus and train.
I highly recommend Terry's accommodation.",1
"Great hospitality, great accommodation, great public transport! It was a very good experience and perfectly prepared for the 4 of us (restaurant tipps, etc.). The apartment is very tidy! It was a wonderful time and I can highly recommend this accommodation!",1
"Great little studio apartment - very cozy. Surprisingly easy parking right outside, plus everything was clean and prepared well. It's one full bed and a pull-out couch (the couch wasn't super comfortable for sleeping, but it worked and the bed was great).

The Uber drivers didn't have anything positive to say about the neighborhood around this apartment, but we didn't have any problems during our stay.

A very minor and somewhat amusing con: the low part of the bathtub is at the opposite end from the drain. No big deal, just a heads up.

The water is great, the electric locks make it simple, and it was an affordable place to stay.",1
We had a wonderful experience.  Terry was very responsive throughout the process.  The apartment was just as described and was impeccably clean.  There was a very nice welcome book with lots of great information.  Highly recommend staying here!,1
"The apartment is exactly as it looks in the pictures, very clean and cozy. The neighborhood did not match the description for Roxbury in our opinion. We were pleased with the close proximity to the metra station. Terry's recommendations were fantastic!! ",1
"Didn't get to meet Terry , but everything was in perfect shape. Beautiful apartment, great location, the walk into the city is a little long (20 minutes) but doable. Street parking was available and we never had an issue finding a spot. Highly recommend Terry's apartment. ",1
"My husband and I had a great stay in the second floor unit. The building is full of original character but also has the conveniences of a modern home. It is located a short walk from the train which will take you right to downtown in 10-15 min. The neighbourhood is also full of character. Although we were not out too late at night we felt very safe walking back from the train. Parking is very limited in the neighbourhood so this is something to keep in mind if you do have car. There is a grocery store a 15 min walk away, which was easy to walk from with a few groceries for breakfasts and snacks. Terry was easy to get a hold of and directions for getting to and into the apartment were very clear. Overall a great alternative to the high priced hotels of downtown. ",1
"Great apartment, beautiful building, easy-access neighborhood. I would definitely stay here again. Slept like a log! For sleeping four I think a couple with two small children would be ok. Thanks Terry!",1
Terry's home was great. We had no trouble checking in or out. It was also very close to everywhere we intended to go. We were evry comfortable and had a great experience!,1
"Terry's place was a great stay. The apartment was roomy and well decorated, very warm. We didn't meet Terry, but everything was prepared for our stay, and we would definitely come back there if we go to Boston again.",1
Very nice place with convenient transportations and comfortable environment. Terry is very helpful. It's a good place and will definitely consider to come again. ,1
"Terry was very thorough in explaining how to get into the studio. The place was exactly like the posting, clean and easily accessible. We really liked the place, it was cozy and comfortable, enough for two people. ",1
"My first time using Airbnb for my visiting parents could not have been better. Valerie, my host, was very welcoming, friendly, and approachable. Accessibility to the place was not a problem since it is very close to the T. I appreciated my host's generosity, and was very grateful to have found this well-hosted place. ",1
Valerie and her family were excellent hosts in Boston.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and it was a great one.  They were very accommodating and gave great recommendations about what to do and explore in Boston for a weekend trip.  Valerie and her family went above and beyond to ensure we enjoyed our trip and if we are ever in the Boston area in the future we will definitely stay with them again!,1
"Hosts were kind, friendly, and accommodating.  The room was clean, cozy, and comfortable.  Basics were provided.  The listing was exactly as advertised.  It's a bit of a walk to the T stop, but it's a straight line through a pleasant neighborhood, and a sort hop on the train to the heart of the city.   Over all, I would highly recommend this listing.  ",1
It was a very nice weekend in the Valerie'home. Valerie and his boyfriend was very friendly and hospitable. Everything was perfect for a quiet stay. This is exactly like on the pictures. We recommend making a visit to them if you want past perfect days. See you soon I hope ! ,1
"This was the first airbnb experience for us. Did not really know what to expect. Valerie and Jason were such nice people, we arrived very late, and jason stayed up and carried our luggage all the way up, and for that matter, down! We loved talking to them, exchanging all kinds of stories. They had maps and city info for us as well, which was great, and gave us good tips how to get around and what to see.  Loved the neighborhood and houses. Room very clean. Nice breakfast! Would recommend them any time!",1
"Valerie and Jason are very nice hosts, they welcomed us friendly and we had nice conversations with them. The room ist absolutly beautiful and you just walk 7-10 min to the T, with the T just 10 min to downtown Boston!The best place in Boston. And Jason speaks spanisch very well:)",1
"I had a great time with Valerie and Jason. They were very kind and attentive hosts.

The room itself was expertly prepared for. It came with lots of towels, a hair dryer, and even bottled water. The room is very spacious and very comfortable. There is even a mini fridge and additional closet space. The only down side is that it can be a bit loud in the morning, not sure if it was a one time thing when I was there, but it is always a good rule of thumb to bring ear plugs. The bathroom was located a bit far from the room, but it was very clean and even had shampoo and body wash for use.  

Valerie was pretty good about responding to my texts promptly. The couple even offered me breakfast and asked me to join them for ice cream. I felt very cared for and at the same time quite independent. I enjoyed my stay very much and would recommend it!",1
"Valerie and Jason were amazing hosts and were very welcoming.  Their house is really a short commute from the T. The room had everything one could possibly need ( washcloths, towels, mini frig, water and etc). I would definitely stay with them again in the future. ",1
Valerie and Jason were very welcoming people. Breakfast is available which is a big bonus and the house is super clean. The area is accessible from airport station and is close to downtown. The harbour walk is good too. Valerie and Jason were good hosts. We enjoyed our stay. ,1
"My stay was lovely!  Valerie and Jason were friendly without being overbearing.  The room was clean and simple.  They are very thoughtful, adding a mini fridge in the room, providing toiletries and fresh towels.  I would highly recommend them to friends and family.",1
Valerie and Jason were great hosts! Both very nice people. Their house is just a short walk to the metro. The home is very beautiful and clean inside. We enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend Valerie and Jason's place! ,1
"Its an incredible place to stay! The bedroom was super comfortable and the room was impeccable as well as the bathroom and the whole house! 

Jason and Valerie were friendly all the time and gave us tips to know the city... Great people!  Besides offered us a delicious breakfast every morning!!! 

My girlfriend and I would definitely stay again in their house! That's exactly what a guest expects to find in an Airbnb host! ",1
Great family! Great location! Everything was just as they stated in the description!,1
"Valerie & Jason were amazing hosts. Even though we had difficulty to get to Boston and arrived hours after midnight, Valery was very kind to us and gave us access to her home which made us feel very welcome. Thanks for the awesome conversations at night and the coffee in the morning.",1
"Valerie and Jason has a beautiful house, nice and clean and not far from the Train station. It's also very convenient to catch an early flight! The room is very clean with new towels and everything I needed. They are really good people and helpful to me. Will stay again.",1
Valerie and Jason were very nice and always helpful. They were very friendly and had a good sense of humor. Valerie's daughter was also a very nice and helpful little girl. They took a great deal of good care for us. The house is beautiful and very close to the airport. ,1
"The house was exactly what we expected, based on the description. It's a beautiful multi-story house in the wonderfully diverse East Boston. There is ample parking close to the house, and plenty of unique places to eat. The train ride (the T), was exactly as far as the listing said it was. Valerie & Jason were so patient with us and our arrival time (since we were driving) and we appreciate that they took time out to welcome us! The bed was so soft and comfy --- so perfect for a long sleep after our 24+ hour drive out there. Valerie & Jason were both exceptionally welcoming and have clearly put a ton of time and energy into making the space as relaxing as it is gorgeous. We appreciate all of the small details they had, including the towels (less for us to pack!), the map of Boston with details, and both taking the time to tell us about some of their favorite things to do here. It was also lovely getting to know Vienna, and hear about what she is learning in school! When I come back to Boston in the future, I definitely plan to contact these guys about staying in their home again! Thank you, thank you, thank you! You guys (and your home) is amazing!",1
"Valerie made us feel very welcome. She made cupcakes from scratch for us!! Delicious. And she let us keep two whole lobsters in her fridge overnight to take to Hartford the next day. Her house is precious, and the location is great... only a few short blocks to the subway. We were in downtown Boston from her front door in about 35 minutes. The room was very comfortable, and clean, as was the bathroom (large, thick towels) and kitchen. Going downstairs to the bathroom was a very minor inconvenience for us, given the huge savings over a hotel room in the city. Overall, we enjoyed our stay (two nights) very much, and will definitely look her up when we return to Boston. She rates an ""A+"" with us. ",1
"Valerie and Jason were excellent and welcoming hosts! we arrived 1 hour later than scheduled, but that was no issue, and the room and the house were even better than the pictures. Breakfast was great, and Jason gave us some great tips for the day around Boston before leaving in the morning. When we got back in the evening, we were able to have a great chat over a couple of drinks. If we ever visit Boston again, we'll certainly be back! :)",1
"Jason and Valerie were wonderful hosts! They were kind and friendly, and gave us great tips for our first trip to Boston. The room was the perfect size for two people. Very comfortable bed, a little refrigerator that they had filled with waters prior to our arrival, and the little air conditioner was a great addition for our summer-time visit. The location is perfect for quick access to the airport. Very grateful that this was our first Air BnB experience. ",1
"We had a comfortable 3 nights at Valerie and Jason's lovely home. 
Valerie and Jason were nice hosts, gave great tips for Boston and were very helpful when we needed assistance with a couple of things.
They have great attention to detail with good quality toiletries and coffee and fruit available. 
The location is great, one or two train stops into the city, 5min drive from the airport.
The bedroom is large & bed is super comfy. The bedroom is two flights from the bathroom which is mildly inconvenient, but the not an issue since the place is so nice and such good value.",1
We had a great time in Boston. We were warmly welcomed and received some helpful advices for exploring Boston. The room is perfect. We definitely can recommend this place!,1
"Valerie and Jason were as accommodating as anyone could possibly ask.  As soon as I showed up, I felt at home.   Jason and Valerie are both up for great conversation and laughs.  If you need any suggestions about seeing the city or where to catch a bite to eat, these two know there way around Boston.  I was absolutely spoiled with a fantastic dinner from their neighbor Rufus, and a little after dinner drink to cap the night off. This will definitely be my go to when I visit Boston.  5 star experience! ",1
We had a really great stay. It was really clean and we really liked the neighborhood. It is very close to downtown Boston. ,1
"Valerie and Jason were amazing hosts, they went out of their way to let us check in super early in the day and made us feel very welcomed in their beautiful home. They were very friendly friendly and loved to have a chat which was great, they provided breakfast each morning which just made our stay in their house amazing, it was so convenient. The listing was exactly as described. The neighbourhood was very safe and in a convenient location, close to public transport, the airport and many convenience stores. I'd recommend Valerie and Jason's Airbnb to anyone, I'd love to visit again.",1
"Valerie and Jason were great in giving good directions to their place. They are very accomodating about our arrival time. Gracious when we arrived and gave us a quick orientation to the bedroom and bathroom. We were there for 3 nights and we felt as though it was a home away from home. They even had breakfast for us everyday in the morning. On one morning, valerie even made delicious banana bread which we truly loved it. I highly recommend this to anyone going to boston. Would book again in a heartbeat. ",1
We stayed for 4 nights in Valeries place and she and Jason were the perfect hosts. The room and the whole house was very cosy and clean. They explained us where we should go in Boston and what we could do. Jason and Valerie are very friendly and they are both very good chefs. I would definitely recommend to stay in their place. ,1
"My mom and I had a wonderful stay at Valerie and Jason's home. The room was clean and cozy, just as described on their profile. It is convenient, located very close to the T in a quiet, friendly neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again!",1
Valerie and Jason were very welcoming and made preparations that really made me feel at home instantly. They were also accommodating of my abnormal travel schedule and made every effort to make sure my trip went as smoothly as possible.,1
"Valerie and Jason were very hospitable. The room was clean and comfortable, and the location is great. ",1
"Unfortunately we didn't get the opportunity to meet Valerie but Jason was very welcoming and his friends helped carry our luggage to the third floor where the room is. The room was lovely and exactly as pictured! A little inconvenient that the washroom is on the first floor but the bathroom is clean and the included breakfast is much appreciated as I am always hungry upon waking up, haha. I love fruit and was very grateful for the fruit available throughout the day. You can imagine how amazing a cold, thirst quenching slice of watermelon is after a hot, humid day! Jason is friendly and open to conversation, it was interesting to discuss cultural differences with him from his interactions with diverse cultures in his previous employment! His expertise in hotel management really shined in all the details of this listing, from the towels and hairdryer to bottled water and noiseless mini fridge. All in all this is a great place to book. The neighborhood may be a hit or miss in terms of how safe you feel based on what you are normally used to. Personally, we felt a little unnerved at night in the dark blackness, and the sidewalks are rather broken, but it's largely fine. We felt privacy in our room and we recommend this airbnb place to everyone!",1
"Staying with Valerie and Jason was a blast. The house and especcially our room just looked as lovely as in the adversement on airbnb. Really recommendable, the place is also in a nice walking distance to T-Station... Everything you need.
And beyond the stay itself we did really enjoy Valerie and Jason in person. They took time to give a map and plenty of details of Boston and offered a lovely (partly) homemade breakfast.
All in all so chilling and fun to talk to. Great hosts. We would come back! Just the bathroom is next to kitchen and not next to the rented room.",1
"
The description in this listing is very accurate.  The location, in particular, is excellent; it's within walking distance to the T.  The cleanliness and the general ambience of Valerie and Jason's home was wonderful.  Our hosts prepared an excellent continental breakfast every morning.  Did I mention the price?  Very reasonable!",1
"This felt like hotel quality service but in a comfortable home! The bathroom doesn't seem like that much an inconvenience once you're actually in the home. It's really conveniently located to downtown, and once you're downtown you can walk everywhere! Valerie and Jason were so welcoming and conversational. We had a fabulous stay. ",1
"My husband and I spent two nights in Valerie and Jason’s lovely home.  They were excellent hosts and really made us feel at home.  The room was lovely, clean and light, with lots of nice touches that you don’t find elsewhere (toiletries, lots of towels, water and mini-fridge).  Jason gives an excellent introduction to Boston, complete with restaurant recommendations (which proved to be very good ones!).  The continental breakfast was great.  The house is in an excellent location – so close to the airport (without being troubled by aircraft noise) and a short walk to the T, which whizzes you downtown really quickly.  We also liked seeing and walking through the local neighbourhood.  Overall, we really enjoyed our stay and would recommend to others.",1
"Great host. Everything is immaculate and thoughtfully planned out. Only thing to make sure you are aware of, is the bedroom is on third floor, and bathroom on first, with the typically steep stairs found in the buildings in this area.",1
"Valerie and Jason were lovely, considerate hosts. On our arrival Jason met us and carried our heavy luggage up to our room, which was much appreciated.
The room description was accurate. Our accommodation was very roomy and comfortable. Valerie and Jason keep their home beautiful and clean which adds to the enjoyment of staying with them.
Jason recommended an excellent Mexican restaurant only a few minutes walk away. We felt safe in the neighbourhood  and there is a laundromat conveniently located on the next corner, parking in the street was no problem. There was some street noise but did not worry us too much. Boston is a beautiful city and the location of Valerie and Jason's home is a 10 minute walk to the metro station which is only two stops to downtown Boston.
Valerie and Jason are very friendly and we enjoyed our chats with them. Jason was very helpful with recommendations of places to see and eat in Boston. This was our very first experience with airbnb and highly recommend our hosts.",1
Our stay in Boston couldn't have bee more perfect. They are located close to the airport and train station so transportation was easy the whole time. The house and room was very clean and welcoming. Would definitely recommend staying here!,1
We only stayed their for one night. It was a great stay and the hosts are very friendly and helpful. We really had a good breakfast (thanks for the muffins and my first eyperience with peanut butter) :-). We would always come back.,1
"My partner and I had an excellent stay at Valerie's modern yet cost home.
The house was very clean and tidy; detailed and accurate advice on Boston and its sights was offered and free bottled water was provided in the room. The room is in the top floor and has air con. There are stairs to the room but this lazy man with a 50lb pack had no troubles.
We found the houses links to both the City and to the airport very convenient and the area seemed safe. There is a serviced laundrette down the block should you feel the need.
Breakfast was toast, fruit and the best strong coffee I have had in the US.",1
I had a wonderful stay. The family was warm and welcoming. The room was very cozy -- very comfortable bed! The neighborhood was nice exploring too.,1
"We stayed here one night.  this location is close to subway, it was easy to look for. Valerie is very nice lady. I couldn't believe her actual age. Accommodation was very clean and comfortable was very warm. If I go to Boston, I would stay here again.",1
"Comfortable and cute room, in a convenient location to the airport and downtown.",1
"Room looks exactly as described and shown in pictures, very clean and tidy.  Hosts were friendly and had nice breakfast (including banana bread muffins!).  Neighborhood is fine, but main selling point is within 10-15 minute walk of blue line making access to downtown easy enough.  Over all a very pleasant experience and give Valerie five stars and would suggest others stay there if visiting Boston.",1
"Our experience was really great with Valerie and her lovely home. We were met by her partner Jason who showed us around - he was very warm and offered us advice on the city. The bed was really comfortable and clean - the room is on the third floor, very private, and there was even a silent mini-fridge stocked with some water for us. In the morning there was a continental breakfast that we could help ourselves to, which was a nice touch.
It's a walk to the airport, close to the T and very comfortable. The bathroom is downstairs, but we had no issue with that. Highly recommend it!",1
Valerie and Jason were lovely hosts-very warm and welcoming. I only stayed one night and had chosen this location because I had an early flight and their home is only about a 10 minute walk from the airport shuttle and the T station.  The location was really convenient.  I found the bed and room very comfortable and there was a nice continental breakfast available in the morning.  Valerie and Jason were really nice and helpful with information and I would recommend it as a great home base for a longer stay in the city. ,1
"Really nice home, clean and spatious. A plus: it's close to the train into town and to the airport, very easy to find. Would recommend it.",1
"Jason and Valerie were very welcoming to my girlfriend and I! They have a very clean and comfortable home in a walkable neighborhood near the Airport T stop. We were shown our airy room, with a VERY comfortable bed, and given a great overview of Boston with a walking map. They provided a yummy breakfast each morning and we were able to let ourselves in each evening after exploring Boston. ",1
John and Valerie and so nice. They told me a lot of attractions to go. I enjoy the trip very much. Will definitely come back if I visit Boston again. I had a wonderful time in their house.,1
"Valerie and Jason were fabulous hosts! Their listing was very accurate; the room was spacious and the bed comfortable. A great place to relax after a day of exploring Boston. They offered breakfast in the morning, which was a great way to get to know Valerie and Jason and swap stories with them. They were very informative and helpful when it came to suggesting places to eat and the parts of town to explore. Their place was a short walk to the subway station, which was super convenient and easy to use. I would highly recommend Valerie and Jason's place to anyone looking for somewhere to stay in the Boston area!",1
"Valerie and Jason are a nice couple who care about making your stay as nice as possible. Lovely home very comfortable and warm. The room is clean and a large size, with enough room. All the essentials you may have forgotten to bring are provided. They also provide an very nice breakfast and we got treated to some delicious homemade muffins whilst staying which was a bonus. The other thing I will say maybe be a downside for some is that your bedroom is on the 3rd level and your bathroom is on the 1st, but we didn't mind too much.  If we are back in the area we would stay again! ",1
Very cosy and modern home. Great breakfast and good tips for discovering the city. Thanks a lot!,1
"Our stay with Valerie & Jason was lovely! The room is exactly as pictured / described and the bed was so comfortable! 

Valerie & Jason went above and beyond to help us. We were in town for a wedding in New Hampshire, and stayed for two nights either side of the wedding. Valerie & Jason asked us if we wanted to leave our luggage at their place for the evening we were away, which was a huge help! 

I would 100% recommend staying with Valerie & Jason. They gave us great advice on what to see, where to eat, exchanged stories with us over breakfast. It was a wonderful experience.",1
What a  wonderful people!!! What an amazing place!! I've  spent one of my best experience as a airbnb user! Thank you so much for that evening with that exquisite red wine!! The place was awesome! And you both are 10 !! ,1
"We felt very comfortable and we absolutely loved the room, the decoration and the little details (breakfast, mini-fridge in the room, a closet). All is exactly as it appears in the ad. The neighborhood was safe and calm, very near of the Airport metro station and Valerie and Jason very friendly! ",1
"Really clean and cozy house. Good location, good room, and Valerie & Jason are good hosts.
If I go to Boston again I'll choose the same place to stay:)",1
"What an amazing place!  CLEAN and COZY! Loved how close this spot was to the Airport T Station.  Only 3 stops away from Downtown as well.  Jason and Valerie were great hosts, very friendly and gave great recommendations for places to check out.  Would definitely stay here again!  ",1
"Valerie and Jason were friendly, welcoming hosts. Extremely prompt with communication with booking. Even though they weren't on-site at the time of my check in, they called and messaged me to make sure I was situated. Cozy, clean home away from home. They also provide breakfast in the morning. Just 2 stops away from downtown Boston by subway. Plenty of street parking too.
The only small inconvenience is that the bathroom is on the 1st floor, and the bedroom on the 3rd - if you're afraid of disturbing everyone in the middle of the night to use it like I am!
But couldn't have asked for a better stay! Would definitely recommend!",1
"Really clean and cozy house. Good location, good room, Valerie and Jason are good hosts. 
If I go to Boston again I'll choose the same place again.",1
"We had such a wonderful time at Valerie and Jason's home! 
The house is perfectly located in a calm neighborhood, but only two subway stations away from downtown and all the sights.
The room is beautiful and sunlit, we absolutely felt at home. And our hosts were really kind, welcoming and good conversation partners... Thank you so much! :) ",1
"Nice host and nice place. Although we arrived late in the evening,  Valerie kindly greet us and show us around the house. She pointed us the way to subway. The breakfast is great!",1

The room was beautiful, clean, warm, and bright. The whole place was spotless and very comfortable. 
There was always food there for us and Jason was great company during breakfast. They were very helpful with directions and recommendations for Boston and the surrounding areas. 
The description of the place was very accurate. This was our best airbnb stay so far, and if we'll be going to Boston again we will definitely try to stay here again. Needless to say we highly recommend this place. ",1

It was a lovely stay at sunny filled room
Comfy large bed 
Quiet place 
Very good located once disembarking your airplane...
Go for it",1
"Amazing house in a quiet family neighborhood. 
Valerie is a caring person, very welcoming and helpful. 
We loves our stay during two nights. the only small damper is that the bathroom is in the first flour (in the kitchen), a little bit far from our room.",1
"We had a great stay in Valerie's house. So many little details and amenities, that we really enjoyed. The place is close to the airport, but the noise didn't bother us that much.. Great advice from Jason for must-sees in Boston and Cambridge. Would definitely recommend to stay here :)",1
"We had a very pleasant stay at Valerie and Jasons home. The room looks exactly as advertised and is very clean and cosy. The location is good for a sightseeing trip especially if you arrive at the Logan international airport.
It was our first trip to Boston, so Jasons recommondations helped us a lot.

They even provided a delicious breakfast every morning ( especially Valeries muffins and cakes are excellent) and waterbottles for our entire stay.

We would definitely stay again.",1
We loved our first experience using Airbnb - Valerie & Jason were excellent hosts and we had a great time in Boston! ,1
"Valerie's home was exactly as it was described and pictured. Our trip was an absolutely wonderful time in a very quiet and beautiful neighborhood in a spectacular house. Valerie and Jason were not there for the majority of our stay but were very prompt on giving instructions in order to get to the house, and get in. When finally able to meet, they both were so warm and welcoming and Valerie even prepared some delicious strawberry muffins! All I know, is that no matter what I am going for in Boston, I will definitely stay with Valerie and Jason again. ",1
"Valerie and Jason were wonderful!  I arrived later than expected but they were very flexible and accommodating.  They offered a delicious dinner while mapping out some local spots for me to see.  Fresh towels, sheets, water, and an umbrella were provided.  Their neighborhood was quiet and only a 5 minute walk to the T.  They were respectful of  my space and privacy while always willing to make conversation. Valerie makes delicious muffins too!

Thank you for making my first trip to Boston a lovely experience! ",1
"We had a Great stay at Valerie's and Jason's house. The room is nicely furnished, it is very clean and we felt just like at home after the first minutes. They had plenty recommendations for us, so wie could enjoy Boston even more. The next tube station is just a couple of minutes away and it takes just two stops to be downtown. It's the perfect location to explore Boston.",1
"Valerie and her family were so welcoming from the moment we met them. From the help of navigating the city, to the clean room, breakfast in the morning, and conversations our entire stay was wonderful. The home is also the perfect location to access the city easily though the T.",1
"Our hosts made us feel very welcome. Upon arrival, they mapped out the city and walked us through the process step by step.
The ad was exactly how it appeared in person! The neighborhood was cute and everyone seemed very friendly!",1
"Our USA speed-trip started with Valerie in Boston, the clean and spacious room is perfect. You can tell that Valerie has an eye for detail and puts in a lot of effort to make everyone feel comfortable. The bed is awesome, as well ass the bottles of water.  Nice sized bathroom with a great shower, and above all a super breakfast. Thank you Valerie!",1
"Super hosts, and the best Airbnb experience so far! Room and everything else is exactly as described in the listing and we are giving a 5* for experience with this nice family, eventhough whiskey was a bit warm :))",1
"We had a fantastic 4 night stay at Valerie and Jason's. They really do offer a 5 star air bnb experience - the room is just as pictured with a very comfy bed, the area is well located for both the airport and the city centre and the little extras they provide (towels, toiletries, breakfast) all help make the stay a great one, but what really makes this place stand out from other air bnbs we've stayed in is their hospitality - Valerie and Jason seem to really enjoy hosting; they're full of tips that help you discover bostons lesser known treasures (like Ciao pizza!), and the welcome we received on our first night set the tone for a really enjoyable visit. We would certainly return and recommend to anyone visiting Boston - thank you both! ",1
"Valerie and Jason have a beautiful home. 
Jason was very welcoming and helpful. He recommended places to visit, which I wouldn't of visited if they were not recommend by a local. 
The house was clean and tidy. And Jason provided breakfast every morning. 
It was a beautiful stay, I would recommend to everyone. ",1
"We can only join previous comments. Perfect Airbnb with very nice hosts, clean and well equipped room and bath, perfect recommendations and very funny morning talks. Thumps up! Only a short way from the airport and close to downtown Boston. ",1
We had fun and exciting days in Boston thanks to the incredible hospitality of Valerie and Jason. The house is located about 10-15 minutes walking distance to the airport subway station. The commute to the historic center takes about 7minutes and a free bus services takes travelers from the subway station to the airport terminals. The house is beautiful and Valerie and Jason made us feel welcome during the whole time of our stay. The bed is really comfortable and the house super clean. We were provided with breakfast and Valerie offered us delicious pastries she made. We can only recommend to stay with Valerie and Jason. Thank you so much for the lovely and extraordinary experience. It was a pleasure getting to know you and staying with you!,1
"We had a great stay here! The breakfast was a wonderful addition, and Jason and Valerie were both very kind and helpful.  The location was also perfect.  We definitely recommend it!",1
"We had a great stay in Boston! Valerie and Jason provided a beautiful private room with many additional amenities that added a ""home-y"" touch. Thanks for hosting us! ",1
Great location that was right next to a rail station and walking distance from the airport shuttle. Valerie was very generous to welcome us into her home. Room was fully equipped with all listed amenities.,1
"I had a nice stay at Valerie's house! The room is clean and comfortable, and the location is good and convenient. I will recommend it to my friends.",1
"Jason's House was very clean and close to downtown. Jason and Valerie were kind. If you are considering a trip to Boston, I would recommend this place. ",1
"Valerie's apartment is very nice, the bed was comfortable and the apartment was clean, we felt warmly welcome and relaxed. Valerie & Jason were the most welcoming and helpful hosts. We would definitely recommend to stay here!",1
"We had a great stay at Valerie & Jason's place! The house is just a 15 min walk from the airport / T-station and Valerie and Jason are excellent hosts. Thank you, Jason and Valerie, for the warm welcome and the useful restaurant recommendations! See you in 2 weeks! :)",1
"Valerie and Jason were so very friendly and kind. They have great recommendations and gave us a helpful map to walk Boston. Their home was cozy and very clean. Guests should be able to climb stairs easily as the room is on the third floor. They provided plenty of towels, pillows, water bottles in our own mini fridge, an AC unit... It was great after a long day of walking a great city! We didn't get to stay very long on our multi-stop trip- but I would definitely recommend this Airbnb! ",1
"Valerie was really nice and she made sure we had everything we needed while we were there. She is literally only a 10 minute walk from the train and we were able to come in and out as we pleased. She was also gracious enough to provide a couple of muffins to us every morning so that we had something to eat before we left every morning. The muffins were great, by the way! I would definitely stay there again if I'm in Boston again.",1
"Everything was as described, the room clean with all the amenities provided. Valerie and Jason were very welcoming and gave suggestions on where we should visit in Boston. The shared bathroom is in tip top condition, in fact, the whole house is maintained really well! Definitely a place to go back to if I were to visit Boston again!",1
It was nice to be back! Thanks again :),1
"Stay at Jason and Valerie was wonderful, everything was perfect. The room was very clean, we had clean towels, cold bottled water waiting for us in the mini fridge, everything was worthy of a 4étoiles service.

Jason and Valerie gave us good advice, where to eat or to see Boston and even a map of Boston.
The house is close to the subway (7 minutes walk) and the neighborhood is nice.

Thanks a lot for a lovely week-end.",1
"Valerie and Jason were very welcoming!  They were very interesting and nice to talk to and made my stay easy and enjoyable.  They are pros at Airbnb and provided everything I needed (including an umbrella for unexpected rain) and ear plugs for the city and airport noise.  The room was comfortable, clean and private.  Of note, the two flights of stairs leading to the bedroom are steep, narrow at places and turn corners, making it difficult to bring heavy luggage up, so bring several small bags if you can, rather than one large. These same stairs must be traversed to use the bathroom two floors below (a bit precarious in the middle of the night, but they thoughtfully leave several lights on throughout so you aren't fumbling around in the dark).  If you are traveling for business (as I was), there is not a desk or table in the room.  I was offered the kitchen table to work at, which I used on one occasion, but it wasn't the best arrangement for me personally.  The location was convenient to the T as promised, with my only note being that if you have rolling luggage, it's quite a schlep up hill and over very uneven sidewalks to get to the house. There are not many restaurants or bars within walking distance, but Angela's Mexican restaurant 2 blocks away had great food (but not so great drinks).  All in all, if you are going to Boston and want to be outside of the city center and not in a hotel, but with easy access to downtown and surrounds for business or exploring, this may be a good choice with great hosts!",1
"Valerie and Jason have a beautiful home which is possibly the tidiest and cleanest place I've ever been! 
The bedroom was very comfortable with an aircon unit with R/C, a fridge with water, earplugs, info on Boston (which sadly I didn't find until just before I left - so do look for it if you stay there) and lots of thoughtful little touches; and Valerie had left breakfast out for me as they were not at home for the first two of my 3 nights' stay. 
I'm so glad I got to meet them on my last evening in Boston! ",1
"Valerie made us feel very welcome and the room, breakfast and advice made our stay in Boston comfortable and enjoyable. The room is spacious and light, and we appreciated the air con unit! The coffee and breakfast each morning was a nice treat and we got lots of local tips for places to eat and visit. ",1
"We hadn't had such a great Airbnb experience for a long time. Valerie and Jason had thought about everything we could possibly need: from earplugs to refrigerated water and yummy muffins for breakfast. The room is very clean, comfy and  cool. Highly recommended. ",1
"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Valerie and Jason's. Upon our arrival we were greeted by Jason who led us to our room. The room is at the top of 3 flights of stairs and was a bit of a challenge with large luggage. He then spent some time talking us through the city of Boston and some activities and places he recommended we visit. 

The room was lovely and thankfully there was AC as the weather was very hot and humid. One note about the AC, it was quite loud, although ear plugs were provided but may be something to consider if a light sleep,luckily we are not. 

There was a breakfast offered every day and was an unexpected surprise. Valerie is a Baker and had fresh baked muffins made every day. 

Overall a great start and would recommend to anyone.",1
"Verlaries home is very neat and tidy. She offers practical advices and the restroom shared with her daughter is also very clean. This is my first Airbnb experience and this is also a journey I took my mum with me. So I think that might be the reason why this didn't suit us very well. In the August is pretty warm and the air conditioner is too loud for a women over fifty. Because this house is well located near the airport train station (blue line), so it is on one hand very convenient, on the other hand the noise from the plane can hardly be ignored. 
In a nutshell, this is a good choice when you travel as young visitors. ",1
"It s a great house and a very big and clean room. Valerie was a nice host, she gave us all the information that we needed to enjoy our stay in boston.
The house is fully equiped and modern.
We defenitly recomend this place.
Thanks for having us.",1
"Jason and valerie's house was great, very nice room, everything was very clean and confortable. The house is a 10 minute walk away from the subway so is really easy to move around Boston.",1
"Our stay was great with Valerie. The location is easy to get to from the airport. She was very responsive to all of our questions. We were able to drop our bags off early and then explore Boston. The hospitality was great. We all chatted over beer, whiskey and cookies. They also gave us great restaurant recommendations. Bed was comfortable and bathroom very clean. We had a great time in their beautiful house! ",1
"It's a lovely place, though have to travel up and down e stairs to use the bathroom. But not a big issue as both the bathroom and bedroom are clean, spacious and nice! Conveniently located down the street from Airport station. The traffic was light during the few days i stayed meant that it was only a short walk.",1
"Clean, airy room with extremely comfortable bed and all the necessary amenities. Beautifully decorated house. Clean and spacious bathroom with all the necessities. Very accommodating, friendly and helpful hosts. Complimentary continental breakfast and coffee! We felt very welcome here.",1
"Valerie and Jason were fantastic hosts!

Their home was very clean and very conveniently located with 10 minutes of the airport and no more than 20 minutes from the places you'd most likely visit.  


I would definitely stay with them again!",1
"Very charming house, in a great neighborhood. Emily was very good with communication, and made us feel welcome. Don't bring a car would be a tip if you stay here, you won't need it and there's nowhere to put it. The house is very close to Boston common and transit, very convenient, Great stay!",1
Emily's place is beautiful and really well situated. She was very friendly and we really enjoyed our stay.,1
"What an amazing place!  If you are wanting to live like a Bostonian for a few days, then this is the place for you!  My wife and I decided to surprise my parents with a trip to Boston and we were looking for a place to stay that would make our trip even more memorable.  This beautiful brownstone definitely delivered!  The location was amazing as it is centrally located to everything you want to do in Boston.  There are numerous T Stations within a few blocks that lets you get wherever you want to go in Boston!  If you have any security concerns, throw them out the window as this property is in a great location!  We even decided to walk back to the property from Fenway after the game one night (30 min. walk) and enjoy all the architecture Boston has to offer!  As for the property itself, it has its quirks but that’s what makes it truly unique!  We loved the exposed brick and small details that just showcased the character of this property.  The outside patio area was so refreshing in the morning’s before we embarked on our adventures and a retrieve in the evening's where we could relive the day's events.  We had some amazing food while in Boston but we fell in love with Mike & Patty's, which is around the corner from the property!  This was our breakfast spot each morning and everything we had was fantastic!  

Now on to Emily... she was so accommodating!  We had an early flight and arrived quite early to Boston.  I had requested an early check-in and Emily quickly obliged.  This was so great as we were able to drop off our luggage and enjoy the City immediately upon arriving!  Thank you again Emily!

If you are wanting to live like a local for a short period of time, stay in a property with true character and be minutes away of the best that Boston has to offer, then book this beautiful brownstone today before someone else beats you to it!  We just hope we get a chance to stay here again in the future!!

Thank you again Emily for making this Weekend a truly memorable experience for my parents, my wife and myself!  And Go Red Sox!!
 ",1
Emily's place was exactly what we expected. Love the charm of the place and location was perfect. I would definitely recommend Emily's place. The patio area was a perfect spot to have coffee in the morning and a drink at night. ,1
"Amazing, high rise unit with city views and all the comforts! I had a great stay here :)",1
"Javier, our host, made our stay in Boston a much more enjoyable experience.  He made us feel welcome right from the start and was available if we needed him at anytime.  It was so nice to share the home with my family and we were able to spend a lot of quality time with each other instead of staying in a hotel.  The home was very nice and looked like the pictures in the listing, which we all were happy about.  It was very clean and nicely decorated.  Also, the neighborhood was nice with restaurants and grocery stores close by if needed.  If we decide to come back to Boston I would not hesitate to request to stay in Javier's home again.  Thank you.",1
"I had a very pleasant experience with Jin. Along with her husband, they patiently waited (even though we had difficulty finding the place at first). They gave us a quick tour of the place, even left some ramen in the shelves for us to cook. The place was extremely clean and we had a very pleasant stay!",1
"Nice, clean apartment with a very convenient location in a safe and fun neighborhood. Jin was available to check us in and answer any questions we had. Our family had a great time and would recommend Jin's apartment to anyone looking to visit Boston. ",1
Great location. Convenient to train and a quick uber ride to all landmarks. Parking included is a nice bonus! Easy check in and check out and great communication from our host Jin.,1
"It is really a nice apartment !! Host is really nice and is really helpful for our trip in Boston. After all, it is an wonderful place to live in Boston.",1
"I stayed Jin's apartment with my husband, my mom, and her friend. We arrived there 2hours behind the check-in time, but Jin kindly adjusted her schedule and welcomed us. There is parking on the property, so we didn't have to worry about parking. That was great!
Her apartment was so clean and comfortable. Neighborhood is quiet. There is a nice supermarket close to the apt., so we were able to get breakfast the next morning.
We all had good time at her place. I'll gladly recommend this place to anyone. Thank you Jin!",1
"Jin and her husband are wonderful host. The place is very safe and quiet. Apartment was clean and as shown in advertisement. Check-in was very easy.  Conveniently located near metro, supermarket and all major shops nearby. 

Downside is little bit expensive. 

",1
"Jin is an excellent host, punctual and accommodating. The apartment was nice, clean, functional and well located. It is reasonably close to Harvard Square our destination most of the time. I strongly recommend doing business with Jin.",1
"Jin was were nice, friendly, and helpful during our stay in her appartment. The appartment itself was clean and equipped with everything one needs. It is located very nicely within Boston. We had a very pleasant time there. I would definitely go there again.",1
Nice size apt in a great location. Jin was very attentive. Would stay again.,1
"Jin was been very kind and available to help us for any problem. The apartment is very beatifull, comfortable and well located. I suggest the place if you want to spend some days or a period in Boston.",1
Jin and Nathaniel met us on time and were very helpful. The apartment is clean and everything works. Locality is good with a local supermarket(24hr)  a block away as well as the local tram service into town. Only issue was lack of parking pass but Nathaniel gave us the remote for their private garage so no problems parking the car.,1
"Had an excellent experience with this rental.  It was very clean, well-stocked, easy access to the T and BU.  Jin was attentive, responsive and kind.  The rental was exactly as it appeared on the website---very spacious and comfortable.  The neighborhood seemed pretty safe although we didn't spend much time there.  ",1
Our experience at Jin's place was very nice. It was very welcoming and the big space of the apartment was the best part of our stay. The apartment is close to a lot of restaurants and it does have a homey feel to it. ,1
This was a perfect space to stay while helping our son move into his apartment in Allston.  It was a good space that had everything we needed and it was a fantastic location close to BU and to the Allston student housing.,1
"Great place to stay. So close to the fenway park. Really clean and we never heard the neighbors during our stay... Will definitely come back for our next trip to Boston

Thanks Jin and Nath",1
"Jin was a great host, and we loved the space. The apartment was really spacious and exactly like it is pictured on the website. Plenty of space for my seven cousins and I in a great part of the city. Definitely recommend!",1
"Very large apartment, just as described. Very clean and well equipped. Close to shops and the T. Great WiFi, perfect for a business trip as ours was. ",1
"The place was incredible, clean and has everything you need, it is perfectly set-up.  Neighborhood is great with near by grocery and lots of places to eat, very safe. Everything is how Jin said it would be!",1
"Great place to live, Jin is an awesome host. Place is exactly as seen in the picture. Very safe and excellent neigh our hood",1
"Great place to live and its very secured, close to shops and restaurants, Jin is an awesome host we are here at his place for more than a month. I am big time user of Airbnb I would recommend to my friends too",1
Jin was very welcoming and I had a great time staying at her place. It was very clean and very large. I would go back there instantly. ,1
"We had a great stay.   Jin was very responsive to messages, and our arrival and departure went perfectly.   The apartment is HUGE.  It was clean and had everything we needed.  It's located in a quiet typical Allston neighborhood.   It was close to the green line and a Star Market is a couple blocks down the street.  She provided a parking permit so I was able to park my rental car.   I have no complaints.   It's not a fancy place, but who needs that?   I would stay there again.  ",1
"Jin was awesome, her instructions were easy to follow and the place was clean and big!",1
"The place was almost perfect. Photos were accurate and place was clean. We had an issue with the hot water at our last day which unfortunately couldn't be fixed in time. Otherwise it would have been a 10/10 experience. But still, the place is value for money and I'll definitely book the same apartment again if I'm back in Boston.",1
"The apartment is very nice. We are four people lived for two days in there. And,there are lots of restaurant nearby. Don't take green line from the apartment,the old line is very slow. Jin didn't reply my message on time when I need help.",1
"Jin is very accommodating. The place is good and clean, my parents enjoyed it very much. Will definitely stay there if future brings me there again :)",1
It is good,1
"Nice apt, nice host. It's near to anywhere. Clean and comfortable.",1
"This was my second time staying with Todd at this house while traveling to Boston and I have to say it was just as enjoyable as the first - this time I was in the Serenity Room  (every room name reflects the ambiance of the specific room and I love that).  The living space, kitchen, bathroom and individual rooms are every travelers dream come true.  Todd makes you feel like your at home.  What I loved the most is that every time I wanted or needed something - Todd had already provided it.   (This has not been my experience at some Airbnb's before).  Ya Todd!   The neighborhood is safe, within walking distance to Harvard Square and Harvard Business School and also easy access to public transportation if you need it.   However, I highly recommend Uber - it's cheaper and faster and more entertaining.   
If you want a superb place to rest your head, then Todd is your Host.   Easy access, delightful communication and may I say clean, modern and hip accommodations.  ",1
"This is a truly amazing home and the host couldn't be better!  The house is a newer home (rare to find in Boston) with all the amenities you could want for a luxurious stay.  Todd has thought of everything and gone upscale across the board - turkish bath towels, super comfortable beds, beautifully decorated interior - we just felt so lucky to have found his home on Airbnb.  The neighborhood is very safe, and it's a beautiful walk along the river to Harvard Square.  We especially loved the new kitchen with everything we needed, and the large living room with a flat screen TV.  There's also free laundry in the basement (new machines) and a nice little deck on the side that's perfect for eating dinner on.  We give this house and host 5 stars for everything.",1
" I enjoyed my stay. The host is great, very welcoming and respectful! ",1
"Very clean apartment, in a nice and secure place. You are in downtown boston in less then 30 minutes. ",1
Wencai was very welcoming and friendly. The room was big and very clean.,1
The room is very comportable and Wencai is a warm-hearted guy. Hopefully I can rent his room again in the future.,1
"This place was in a beautiful area of Boston. The listing did describe it well, however we were surprised to find out we were staying on the sixth floor and the elevator is quite scary. We unfortunately had terrible neighbors. They ruined our first night there by throwing a college party next door. We contacted Inn Boston and they were helpful with the situation, but due to snow no one could come out. We did get refunded and they cannot control rude guests.",0
The place was fantastic; it was very well kept and with all amenities noted ready and available. The location is great; it was nice to be able to have the park so nearby along with Newbury street only a few blocks away. A very quaint and lovely location for a weekend get-away.,1
"Their staff is super helpful when I book the suite. The suite is good, I will say I love it. But is not very clean though. Although there was no dust, I saw few hair in the bathroom and one the bath towel, also the quilt has some yellow spot on it. 
But overall the apartment is good and comfortable.",1
"The place was great, just as it looks in the photos, and the whole process was quick and easy! Great spot to stay at in Boston with lots going on around it. Thanks for everything.
-Will",1
"The listing was exactly as pictured, and conveniently located right next to the Boston common and steps away from the storrow Dr bike path leaving us with many opportunities to see exactly what Boston had to offer. Great place to stay",1
"Terrific location where Beacon Hill meets Back Bay. Great location for shopping and taking in the Public Garden and the Common. 

The apartment was clean and pretty well maintained. A few furniture items could use a refresh, such as a damaged lamp shade and a broken drawer. Overall, a good experience. ",1
"This is a great, mysterious old building in a residential/collegiate location and we sort of enjoyed our stay here. However, not as much as we had hoped. Our previous airbnb stays have been with privately managed units that included a few personal touches. These go a long way in creating a good experience. Inn Boston is apparently not of that mindset. We arrived late at night, and though I thought I had been proactive by grinding some coffee beans to bring so we could start our first day right, there was not a single coffee filter for the coffeemaker. (It also would have been nice to have a couple bottles of water in the fridge, but this was not entirely expected.) But how about no bar of soap or shower gel in the bathroom? I suppose we could have washed up with the dish soap from the kitchen, but instead we set out to find a market. Everything was closed except for a drugstore a long walk away, which did not have the coffee filters. And alas, two bath towels, one hand towel and one washcloth were not sufficient for two people over a three day stay.  Anyone planning to come here should expect to get their shins bruised on the hidden corners of the bed - more than once. And finally, if you are driving here you might want to bring your own pillows. Other than the management's lack of attention to detail this could be a nice place to stay.",1
"We had a great 4 day stay at this apartment.
The location is perfect as it is from walking distance to Boston common and the start of the Freedom Trail, Newbury street, Charles street, Cheers bar and mostly to anything downtown Boston.
The apartment itself is well equipped and as shown on the pics on the site.
We stayed in apartment 5R and for those who don't like stairs their is an ""historical"" lift.
The checking in is very easy and well informed in advance.
Definitely recommend for visiting Boston.",1
Excellent property in perhaps the best location in Boston.  Plenty of space - nice high ceilings and sash windows - and we enjoyed the terrace at the back.  There is good bedroom/bathroom space downstairs; this is below ground level so there is less light here.  Peter was extremely helpful and responsive: we couldn't have wished for a better host.  Worth mentioning parking: this is central Beacon Hill so there is no street parking for visitors but the Boston Common underground parking is extremely convenient and not unduly expensive.,1
"It was a great experience!!!  The townhouse is just great, location couldn't be better (right in front of Boston common park) and Peter is an awesome host.
I strongly recommend this place.",1
"We enjoyed our time at Peter's home. The location is perfect for someone that wants to be in the middle of Boston. Public transit is close and you can walk anywhere you need to go. 

A great deal of history to the home and the Beacon Hill area. Peter and his family were hospitable and available if needed.",1
"Excellent home and location. Fantastic experience. 
",1
"Absolutely loved this house. Peter was very gracious and everything we needed was there. The house is gorgeous, and the location could not be better. I wish we could have moved in permanently, but alas.. all good things must come to an end. If we end up coming back to Boston we will certainly stay here again.",1
"We had a great time staying at Peter's apartment.  The property was in a great location and was a great size for the number in our party.  Peter was a friendly, responsive and helpful host.",1
Perfect location with a very lovely house.,1
"We greatly enjoyed our time at this Beacon Hill Airbnb! It was very comfortable for my 3 colleagues and myself and could easily accommodate at least 3 other guests. It was very clean, well-stocked and had a beautiful common space and kitchen for us to use in between our work commitments. It would also be a lovely place to stay as a tourist.  It is in a great location right off of Charles Street (which is populated with great little restaurants) and has a beautiful view onto the Common and easy access to many T-stops (including Arlington & Charles St). Peter and his family were very accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable during our stay. We would definitely return the next time we are in Boston!",1
"Peter was very welcoming and very accommodating with our arrival time into Boston. The pictures did not do this house justice... much better in person.  The huge dining room allowed for enjoyable, relaxing  family dinners. The kitchen was very spacious compared to other Boston condos/townhouses. This townhouse is the perfect location for anyone wanting to tour Boston. Thank you Peter for opening your home to us! ",1
"Peter was a fabulous host. He made advanced arrangements to accommodate our requests, made sure the unit was well equipped, and allowed us to feel at home while renting part of his home. This location is UNBELIEVABLE! We could see the famous Mallard family and swan boats out our window. Steps to Charles St and 1 mile walk to everything we needed. We barely used public transport, which is about 8 min walk away. We walked to Newbury St, North End, the Esplanade, even the Children's Museum. Way better than staying in a hotel as a group of 3 adults and 3 kids. 

Beds were comfortable, well appointed, with ample linens. W/D and fridge make travel with children much more comfortable.",1
"Peter was there to welcome us at the gate the moment we arrived. he gave us a quick tour of the apartment and made us feel welcomed from the very first moment.
The location of the apartment is excellent. On one side we have Charles street, a happening street with very good food outlets in front we have the park. whatever is wanted is only walking distance.
We were family of 7 ( 7 adults and 1 child). there was enough space for every one.  The kitchen was very well equipped with with utensils. 
The living room and the dining area was big and very comfortable.
Interaction with peter was good as they were staying on the top floors. we also had an opportunity to meet his wife. we shared good few moments  with them.
Due to the location movement was very easy as Taxis were available at call, the underground metro system was walking distance.

"My stay with Pam and Sara was wonderful!  I received a quick response to my inquiry and, as this was my first airbnb stay, had all my questions on the process answered fully.  Although I am familiar with JP, I asked for input on where to get some food, directions, and traffic information.  Pam was spot on with all of her recommendations and information.
The shared space is beautiful with nice light, an open floorplan, and a relaxed feel.  The kitchen has all that one would need.  The bedroom and bath are totally private, large, and very comfortable.  Pam and Sara provide all that one would want in the room such as a coffee machine, cable, and Internet access.  Everything was spotless.
As a first time airbnb user, Pam and Sara have made me an enthusiastic fan!   ",1
"The room is spacious, luxurious bathroom. They were friendly and welcoming.",1
Pam and Sara made us feel very comfortable. They are both warm and interesting people. You will enjoy meeting them and the accommodations are spacious and comfortable.,1
"Stayed at Pam and Sara's for two nights and really, this was the best airbnb experience I had so far. Great location from the T, cosy neighborhood, spacious room and bathroom even though we squeezed in 3 persons on the first night, towels and linens were provided as well. The place looks so much better in real life and the bed is very very cosy. Pam always check with us if we knew how to get around Boston. I loved the short 15mins walk to Arnold Arboretum because the neighborhood is very charming. Because my room mate and I had a late night Greyhound bis to catch, they let us leave our luggage with them for the day while we explored downtown. Thank you very much for hosting us!!",1
"We had a great stay with Pam and Sara!  We had our own roomy, private floor in their lovely house.  They made us feel right at home, helped us with directions and even let us sample some homemade delicious gluten free pasta and a little wine.  We would definitely stay with them again if we visit Boston!",1
"Pam and Sara have a lovely home in a convenient neighborhood.  The room is bright and spacious, and the attached bathroom is amazing.  Overall, it was a great stay, and I enjoyed my time at their place.  I visit Boston regularly and would definitely stay again.  Highly recommended. :)",1
"Nice light room with adjacent private bathoom. Both very clean. 
Several cafes for breakfast within walking distance, we recommend Ula cafe for breakfast and for dinner try the Milky Way next door from Ula cafe. 
Pam and Sara were great hosts, they gave us a lot of tips about what to do and where to eat. We liked their breakfast, they had waffles, yoghurt and chocolate croissants for us. 
Very good access to all interesting parts of the city.",1
"This is a nice private space - the room had a very comfortable bed, and the bathroom was spacious.  Pam and Sara were very helpful and knowledgeable about the area. This is a great spot for someone needing a temporary base in Boston!",1
"I stayed at Pam and Sara's with my boyfriend for a weekend trip to Boston. This was our first time using airbnb and it couldn't have been any better. We were hesitant about staying in someone else's home, but we thought it was better than a hotel stay. The price was much better too! Pam was away but Sara was a gracious host and made us very comfortable. She helped us when asked with directions and suggestions and have us privacy the rest of the stay. The room was clean and had plenty of space with a large bathroom. Overall our first experience was great thanks to sara! Id recommend anyone to stay here. ",1
"The room is so large,beautiful,cozy,and even has a private (URL HIDDEN) both are gracious.I really wish I can be so luck to rent their room next time.",1
"My husband and I had a great experience staying at Sara and Pam's place when we were visiting Boston for a wedding. Arrival and key pickup were smooth and pleasant. During the weekend we had a chance to chat with both Sara and Pam, who are kind, friendly, and helpful people, and we loved their cat, Derby. The upstairs area where we stayed--bedroom and super roomy bathroom--was clean, comfortable, and stocked not only with basics such as towels and soap, but nice extras like snacks and a Keurig coffee maker. The house itself is quiet and peaceful, and there was definitely a sense of privacy and independence for our entire stay. We had access to the kitchen, though we ate every meal out and primarily just used the kitchen to grab glasses of water, which is of course essential. The only downside to staying in this area of Jamaica Plain was the blaring music out of car windows during certain parts of the weekend, and some other city noises, but this didn't bother us too much. The house isn't too far a walk from the Green St. T stop, so we used this (as well as Hubway bike share) to get into other parts of Boston. A couple cute cafes are on the way to the train, and we enjoyed these, as well as some other restaurants in downtown JP (along Center Street). And one of the nicest things about JP is surely all the natural spaces, like Jamaica Pond and the Emerald Necklace parks. We didn't get a chance to see the Arnold Arboretum, so we will surely have to come back sometime. Overall, I would say Sara and Pam's place is an amazing bargain, a great spot to anchor your trip to Boston, and not at all too far from the city center if you're willing to navigate public transit.",1
Sara and Pam are great hosts and offer a peaceful retreat from the city while being close to good restaurants and gardens and transit. The bed is so comfy with its soft pillowtop mattress. I slept very well. The snacks and Keurig coffee maker are a nice touch. Sara and Pam were okay with me leaving the luggage for the day the day I left so I could tour the city unencumbered. The Arboretum was lovely and Cafe Ula serves a mean mozzarella-fig sandwich. Derby the cat helped me feel at home by talking to me and letting me know what she wanted (to be let out and to be petted- I could help her only with the latter). It was a perfect stay and I hope their place is available when I return to Boston.,1
We loved our stay with Pam and  Sara! The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean. The space is private and very quiet. The neighborhood is charming and we felt safe taking a  short walk to the subway  every day. Pam and Sara are great people willing to lend us guidebooks and answer our questions about the best places to eat and neat things to see. Would gladly stay with them again-highly recommend!! Thanks for a wonderful first air bnb stay!,1
"Pam and Sara were wonderful hosts!! They were flexible, responsive and super friendly. The room itself was also lovely and was the only bedroom on the top floor and had an attached bathroom. It was a really nice space. I would definitely recommend staying with them and would stay there again in a heartbeat. ",1
"My stay with Pam and Sara was my first airbnb experience, and it couldn't have been more pleasant! The property is in a classic Boston neighborhood, but the many updates made it feel in many ways like a brand new home: clean, comfortable, and inviting. I travel often and I'm much like Winston Churchill when he said, 'I am easily satisfied with the very best.' The bed was sleep-inducing, the room well-appointed, and the private bathroom put it over the top. It was spacious, new, clean, and had a powerful shower. 
Pam and Sara were consummate hosts. Both were engaging and available when needed, but allowed for privacy. Their knowledge of the area is unmatched, and there were plenty of books and maps available for those times when they might not have known an area. Excellent hosts, great place, great neighborhood. I'm fearful if I say more I may not be able to stay here again as it is likely to be (URL HIDDEN) it should be. Don't miss it if you have the opportunity.",1
"We stayed with Pam and Sara for a night as we passed through Boston for a day. The accommodations were wonderful--comfy bed, spacious bathroom, totally private space. We only got to meet our hosts briefly because we were out all day, but they are so sweet and helpful, giving us ideas of what to do and how to get around with public transit. We'll definitely be staying there again next time we go through.",1
"Sara and Pam's house is great! Really easy to get into the city! And they offer you everything what's needed! The bed is really comfortable and you have a huge bathroom for your own!
We just stayed there for two short nights (late arrival and early delivery) but I would recommend it also for people who like to stay longer!",1
"Pam and Sara were great hosts! They had maps and books about the area, and were very helpful when I had questions. They made me feel right at home. ",1
"We needed a place for 1 night with easy access to the Longwood Medical area, and Pam & Sara’s condo turned out to be very well situated. Their building is located on a corner in a largely residential section, about 1 block from a busy major street. On-street parking was available but not exactly plentiful when we arrived in the late afternoon. 

Pam and Sara were very personable and responsive hosts, replying to my prearrival inquiries in less than an hour and thoroughly answering all my questions.  They were very helpful in person, too, particularly with recommendations for places to eat and shop in the immediate neighborhood.

Their 3rd floor accommodations were clean and spacious; everything was in good working order, although the speed of the wireless internet seemed to vary a lot and was rather slow at times.  Unfortunately the bed turned out to be much softer than we’d like, and the street noise was quite a bit more than we’re used to (despite closed windows), so overall it wasn’t the most restful night for us.

Although we didn’t use the T, it would have been an easy walk to the nearest stop – we strolled past it on our way to a tasty breakfast the next morning at a nearby café.   By the time we checked out, most of the morning commuter traffic had subsided and it took us about 20 min to drive to Longwood, just as Pam & Sara had predicted.  
",1
"It was our first time visiting Boston and we needed a place to stay for five days, four nights. We chose Pam & Sara's place because it came off as very welcoming... And surely it was! Pam & Sara are great hosts and they made themselves available in case we had any questions or concerns. The accommodation is very homey, clean, comfortable AND it is even private! The location is awesome as the neighbourhood has lots of little, fun cafés and shops and it is very close to public transit. Definitely would recommend! ",1
"It's a little unfair that my first AirBnB was this great. It's gonna be a tough act to follow.  Nice and private, cool neighborhood, great location with easy access to the train to get around.  There was nothing more I needed. ",1
"I stayed in Sara and Pam's home in JP for 2 nights. Our schedules didn't allow for us to actually meet, but they were available over text to answer any questions and they left a message for me on the door at my arrival. I loved the space - a large room on the third floor with a private resfloor - and the neighborhood was quiet with gorgeous Victorian style homes and cute cafes. The apartment is super close to the orange line and easy to get into the city center. I'd definitely stay again.",1
"Pam and Sara were awesome hosts! Super friendly, very accommodating and welcoming. The cat is sweet and friendly :) The room itself is very comfortable, with a particularly nice spacious bathroom en-suite.  I'd definitely love to stay again!",1
Our first experience in Airbnb was great thanks to Pam and Sara! They were really helpful and great with our 9 month old baby boy. The house is amazing and the fact that we were on our own floor with a huge bathroom made our stay even better.  ,1
"We arrived in Boston in the afternoon at around 1 pm, and it took us 20 mins to reach Jamaica place using the subway. We got off at forest hills station and Pam & Sara's place is just a 5 min walk from this station, very easy to navigate and reach there, they had everything that they mentioned in the listing, absolutely fresh and clean and ready to use. Unless you want to stay in the main city overlooking the harbour this is a very good option, i would surely recommend it for a couple !!",1
"Pam & Sara were wonderfully accommodating. The bedroom is as pictured, clean, roomy, with flat screen TV, comfortable. Large bathroom w/ shower/tub is excellent. Complete access to nice kitchen. House is beautifully restored and solid underfoot. Friendly cat appreciates a little love but not intrusive.  ",1
"Pam & Sara are great hosts. They were not home, when we first arrived but everything was ready for us and there was also a map to find the local restaurants easily. The room was very nice and comfortable. And we liked that Pam & Saras place was not far from the metro. We enjoyed our stay!",1
"This location is in walking distance from shops, parks and public transportation. Pam and Sara were very gracious hostesses! I even spent time chit chatting with them and had the most delightful conversation. They were extremely helpful in finding local places to eat, directions on how to get around and even offered an umbrella because the weather forecast was calling for rain. The bed was comfy, the tv was big and had plenty of channels to choose from and the bathroom was huge! I will definitely stay there again!",1
"Pam and Sara's place was both conveniently located and incredibly comfortable. The room was quite large on the top floor with its own private bathroom, which gave us a lot of privacy. On top of that, there was a large TV with cable and a coffee maker – just like a hotel but a million times cozier. Both Pam and Sara were incredibly kind and welcoming, accepting our stay very last minute and giving us free reign of their kitchen when needed. What a great stay! ",1
"Great stay in Jamaica Plain! Pam and Sara were very personable and very accommodating for our arrival and departure, and they are located just a few minutes' walk from the Boston subway Orange Line, which makes it fairly easy to access other parts of the city. The room is a good size, with a comfortable bed and an attached full bath.",1
"This was my first airbnb experience and it was a great one. Pam and Sara were friendly hosts and I felt at ease as soon as we got there. The room was well-lit and clean, the bed was comfortable, and our private bathroom was clean, spacious and well taken care of. The bedroom even had a coffee maker that I used to make coffee each morning. Ten minute walk to the Green Street T station. Loved the local coffee shop & bakery that was only about few blocks away. Heart of JP less then a 10 minute walk away. Overall it was a great experience and, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in the Jamaica Plain area.",1
Pam and Sara have a lovely private room and bathroom that was perfect for our brief stay. They were gracious and friendly and great sources of info for local eating and activities. We would definitely stay here again!,1
We felt at home from the minute we walked in.  The room was spotless and a decent size for the two of us.  The room is at the top of the house which was great for all parties involved as we felt we had our own space.  The en suite bathroom was lovely and spacious as well with towels included.  The Green St T station was only a 5-10 minute walk away.  The area of JP was a lively and diverse area with plenty of pubs/restaurants and quirky shops to suit any taste or budget.  JP was an affordable location close enough to get to downtown Boston (15-20 mins).  Pam and Sara are a lovely couple who were extremely helpful throughout the booking process and during our stay - we shared a drink and had a great evening.  Their cat Derby was very friendly and cute!  ,1
"Our first stay with Airbnb at Pam and Sara's place was great. Very nice place and a total home feel. 
 Very convenient to anywhere in Boston on T. Plenty of parking in the neighborhood to leave the car there and explore the city. 
    Pam and Sara were super nice and flexible in terms of checking in time  and suggesting things to do while there to get most out of our time. BTW I was in the city with my 10 year old daughter to explore the city and it worked as expected. 
",1
"Staying at Pam and Sara's was home away from home. This was mine and my boyfriend's second AirBNB experience, and while our last experience was so lovely as well, I really loved the privacy of having a floor practically to yourself and a connected bathroom, which was ENORMOUS and so nicely renovated and lovely. The room came with a large TV with cable, which my boyfriend and I don't have at home, and at times I had a little trouble tearing his eyes from the screen back to me, but we had such a comfortable stay. The room is MUCH bigger than in the picture, has tons of space and so private. Derby was a sweetheart also. Didn't have the pleasure of meeting Pam, regrettably, but Sara was very warm and accommodating, and did everything to make us feel at home and comfortable. ",1
"GREAT stay!  Everything was just as stated - nice, large room and bathroom:)  I loved the neighborhood and it was very easy to get every where using the T.  Pam and Sara even provided a Charlie Card for me to fill and use - great idea!   I highly recommend staying here! ",1
Pam and Sara were great with their communications. They responded promptly to all emails and texts. Morning of our arrival they contacted us to let us know that they were going out to breakfast and would leave they key for us. Met Pam in the afternoon and she answered every question about Boston and gave the best advice about taking the subway instead of the car. The subway was walking distance from their place and saved us a ton of aggravation and parking expense while spending the day in Boston. Room was as described and perfect for our overnight stay. Would stay with them again! ,1
"This was my first time using Airbnb and it was great! Just as described, we had a nice bedroom with a huge bathroom en -suite.  The room was on the top floor so we had our own space.  The house was 5 min walk from T (Orange line, Green Street) and it took us about 10 -15 min to get into the city center. Pam and Sara provided us with all necessities, including Keurig coffee maker with K-cups.  There was also a  flat screen TV, AC, and a wireless internet. They have a lovely cat Derby that visited us, but was not intrusive.  Unfortunately we did not meet Pam and Sara in person as they were away (they had to leave due to family circumstance), but they were great with their communications. We had no problem finding the house and getting into it using lock box, as well as using free street parking. They even left some recommendations about the neighborhood and good places to eat (which we used). We stayed in-touch until our departure and Pam was updating us regularly about their plans.  Although we never met in person,  Pam's communication was so caring that I felt like part of the family. I really hope that next time we are in Boston we can stay with Pam and Sara and meet them in person.
Thank you, Pam and Sara!",1
"Clean room with a large private bathroom, comfortable bed. Nice neighborhood with a good connection to the city center.",1
"Pam and Sarah were great hosts. They were there whenever I needed anything, but virtually invisible the rest of the time. Their place was in a great location for subway access and food. 
I would recommend their place. ",1
"Pam and Sara's home was lovely. The room and bathroom had everything we needed, and thr location of the home was great as well. We were able to park our car on the street for free and use the subway system, with a stop only minutes away from their home. We did not have much contact with Pam and Sara as we were out most of the time, but the few times we did chat, they were helpful, warm and fun to speak with. Also very quick to respond to queries via airbnb. Overall a great base to explore boston and surrounding areas.",1
"I stayed at Pam and Sara's place for a couple of nights during my visit to Boston. Not only was this my first trip to the city but also my first Airbnb experience and both Pam and Sara couldn't have been more helpful. Bar has been set high for any other stays I will have elsewhere. From the pre-booking time, when I emailed them with questions to my departure, Pam and Sara were accommodating and when I arrived, I discovered that both girls were gluten free and Pam gave me a few suggestions of where to go for food. I also got a few ideas of places to visit, in addition to the ones I had listed.
They offer their guests the use of a Charlie card which is cheaper than the Charlie ticket. In the bedroom, which has a comfortable double bed and a large private bathroom, you find maps and guide books, for even more ideas on visiting the town. 
On the day of departure, I was able to leave my bag in the house and collect it before my train was due.
I really enjoyed my stay and wouldn't hesitate to book the same place if I came back to Boston.",1
"Pam and Sara's apartment was great- in a great location with a super friendly cat. I unfortunately didn't get to meet either of them, but Pam was very helpful with directions. Thanks! ",1
Thank you Pam and Sara for letting us stay in your nice room. The house is in a very nice area with great connection to the city center. We had a wonderful time in Boston.,1
"Pam and Sara were wonderful hosts. We booked the trip several months in advance, and they were communicative throughout the process. We appreciated all the tips and recommendations during our stay, and wished we had stayed longer to enjoy more of the sights of Boston and its surrounding towns. Their home is in a walkable area and about 5-7 minute walk to the T. There are several parks, cafes, and restaurants within walking distance, not to mention the Sam Adams Brewery tour. Their home is warm and comfortable. We loved meeting Pippi! The room was a lot larger than shown in the picture. The bed was super comfortable, especially after having been on tired feet for several hours during the day. And the bathroom, wow! Very large and clean.  thank you Pam and Sara!",1
Pam and Sara were great hosts! They provided me with lots of great information about local restaurants and coffee shops as well as good spots to check out in Boston. The room was clean and comfortable and the location is quiet. I'd definitely stay here again! ,1
"Easy, communicative host, with lots of helpful recommendations. Quiet location and very sweet dog! Close to Sam Adams brewery and easy access on T. Would stay here again!",1
"Had a great stay with Pam and Sara.  Room just as described, nice and spacious, very comfy bed and a large ensuite.  Pam and Sara were both lovely and inviting, will give you privacy or are on hand to provide tips and share their knowledge of the area.  Their dog Pippi is also gorgeous and loves to meet new guests!

Jamaica Plain is a fairly quiet neighbourhood with shops, cafes and pubs, not forgetting the zoo and Samuel Adams brewery! 

Only 20 mins on the Orange line to downtown Boston, this place is perfect for a short or long trip, we would definitely visit again if we are in the area.",1
"We didn't get to meet Sara, but Pam was so warm and welcoming, as was their sweet dog, Pippi, who was friendly, quiet, and well-behaved.  The room is even bigger than the pictures indicate.  Comfortable bed and chair.  Bright and clean.  Keurig in the room is a nice touch.  And the bathroom is beautiful, new, and clean with a great shower.  Their condo is in a very nice neighborhood, quite convenient to everything we needed.  A nice experience indeed.  Would definitely come back again.  Thanks, Pam and Sara.",1
"Staying with Pam and Sara was great! I took the T train from the airport. The walk was very easy. Do remember that it is 3 flights of stairs to access the room (I didn't mind, but for those of you who aren't stair fans just an FYI). 

Pippie their dog is very friendly and quiet. I don't think I ever heard her bark. When I arrived, Pam and Sara were not home. I made my way up the stairs to a very clean and welcoming room. It does look exactly like the picture. The bed is very comfy, and having cable is a plus!

I did not spend too much time at the house. Pam was very helpful in terms of transportation and places to see.  For those of you who are looking for a place to exercise, Jamaica Pond is about 1 mile from their place. ",1
"It was very easy to get a hold of Pam and Sara, and checking in was very painless. The location was as advertised, and the space was better than I expected. The attached private bathroom was huge, and the bed was very comfortable. 
They left me to enjoy my trip, but did take time to leave me a map and a Charlie card. ",1
Pam and Sara were good hosts and the apartment was perfect. Good location and very clean! Would stay there again!,1
"Pam and Sara were very welcoming. I could tell they had guests before and let us know most of what we needed without having to ask. 
We didn't have much interaction during our stay other than getting references for sites to see and advice on getting around. They were very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to where to go and how to use the subway. They also provided us with a bus pass that was refillable which discounted the cost. 
If you're there on a Thursday make sure you check the parking signs. You don't want the street sweepers sweeping up your car! Thanks Pam helping us on that one :)
",1
Pam and Sara were great hosts. We really enjoyed staying at there place. The appartment is close to the subway and there was free street parking in front of the house. The room and bathroom were really nice and big. ,1
"Really comfortable bedroom with a huge and clean bathroom. The apartament is in a good area near from the T, markets.. We would definitely stay there again.",1
everything as described. highly recommended.,1
Thank you Pam :),1
"Sara and Pam are great hosts,  we are very greatful to them for helping us when we were in trouble. We agree with all the positive things that were said about the place, but there are two things for the guests to pay attention to. First, there are 42 steps leading from the road where you park to the room.
Second, on hot summer days it's important to ask the hosts to switch on aircondition (which works very well), because it's central. The hosts will do it without any problem.",1
We really enjoyed to stay at Pam and Sara's home and their dog Pipi is really lovely. It's close to the T and parking it's not a problem. The bedroom and the bathroom is great and they gave us usefull information's for visiting Boston. I would stay there everytime.,1
"Donny and Chris were great hosts. Very helpful with detailing the fine things Boston had to offer. Beautiful well appointed apartment in South Boston. Parking in the area mostly requires a resident permit except on weekends. There is a modern well run parking garage a short walk from there apartment.  Nice classic style diners in the neighborhood as well as a Starbucks, Boston sports club just a short distance away. Well connected with bus and subway. Great experience. ",1
"Donny and Chris were very welcoming and great hosts. They have a beautiful apartment in South Boston - very comfortable and in a safe area. I was in town for a conference and this was a very convenient location. It is well connected with the subway and just a couple blocks off Broadway, which has a number of coffee shops, restaurants, convenience stores and energetic vibe.  I would recommend Williams Tavern around the corner on A and Third as a friendly neighborhood watering hole as well. 

Overall, very nice accommodations with great hosts in a fantastic location near the conference center. A+ guys. ",1
"Donny and Chris were really helpful and sociable. They made sure I knew my way around in the city, and thanks to them I was able to make the most out my (relatively short) stay in Boston.

The apartment was great and spotless, located in a nice neighbourhood and very close to the convention center and subway station.

Would definitely recommend this place!",1
"Donny and Chris' place was gorgeous. I picked the location based on the proximity to the convention center--a nice 10 minute walk--and the metro line, but I didn't expect the condo to look more immaculate than the photographs. 
Despite the fact that I could not find the right building even though it was across the street, Donny went out of his way to accommodate my stay. He and Chris were great hosts and encouraged to make myself at home. 
Great people; great place; great neighborhood. ",1
"Excellent. Very courteous and respectful. Very friendly and accommodating. The place was very clean and tidy. Bathroom was spotless and kitchen was very well equipped and inviting. Air conditioner made the apartment nice and cool, and this was adjustable. No hesitation at all to recommending this place to anyone. ",1
"Was very nice and welcoming -- accommodated my trip on short notice. The place is beautiful with great mid-century inspired furnishing and original accents. Extremely clean and well cared for. Bedroom, bathroom and living space was all very well cared for. Hotel quality!",1
"Donny and Chris are really great hosts and super people. And the place was wonderful. Beautiful open space, great kitchen and the bedroom and the bathroom were clean and welcoming. I loved the windows and the natural light. I just wished I'd had more time to enjoy this space - my business trip kept me busy elsewhere during the days. I'd recommend this location to any of my friends heading to Boston.",1
"Donny and Chris were extremely welcoming. I had a full bathroom to myself, the shower being Euro-style glass and cultured stone. My bedroom was big, bed was comfy, and there was desk for doing work. If you like hearing the birds chirp, there is a tree right outside the window. Wifi was fantastic; FaceTime never looked better. Neighborhood is totally hipster/young prof/startup vibe, which was perfect. BCEC is a 15 min walk easily down D Street, and I had my own key to come and go as I pleased. Apt building is quiet for doing work. I would stay here again if I was attending another conference at BCEC.",1

"This unit is AMAZING.  Very spacious, updated, neat and clean.  Great location.  This should actually be listed under a private room listing as this is not an entire home, but a rather a shared 2bd/2ba unit.   I had a private room and bath but share apt with the owner (perhaps I missed this point while reading this listing).   With that being said, I never ran into Donny but corresponded with him via text.  He is very nice and wanted to ensure my stay was great.  ",0
"Donny was a great host. He was very flexible with my early morning check in time. He communicated very clearly and provided everything I needed to have a comfortable, worry-free stay. Will return next time I'm in the area for a conference. ",1
"I was in Boston for a conference and found Donny and Chris's listing after my hotel rez was botched.  What a wonderful find! 

They are great hosts and made sure I knew where everything was and how it worked, and gave me a list of some of their favorite restaurants, too.  They were headed out for the weekend so I had the place to myself.  (I wasn't there much due to meetings, etc.)

Their home is everything that is described...super clean, well appointed, and very comfortable.  I especially liked the secure entrance.  There's a small children's park next door if you want to sit outside.

It's very quiet at night and I honestly didn't hear another person in the four days I was there.

I found two breakfast diners within a four block radius that were both great so an easy walk in the morning was a great start to the hectic  conference days.  

Transportation is stunningly easy...I didn't have a car.  There are tons of Uber drivers available and I didn't have to wait more than 4 minutes or so for them to arrive.  The T station is nearby as well.

Two thumbs up for this room!",1
The host is very helpful during my stay in his home. He is willing to provide what I need. He is very thoughtful and makes me feel comfortable in his home. I had a great time visiting Boston and staying in his home.,1
"Donny did an amazing job of hosting me for my recent trip to Boston. Not only was he a great host, making me feel very welcomed, he was very responsive with any questions I had.

The place was impeccably clean and tastefully decorated. Would highly recommend this place if you are looking for somewhere near Seaport.

Would certainly stay again!",1
Amazing condo in an even better location! Donny & Chris went out of their way to make my first trip to Boston one that will keep me wanting to come back! ,1
"Gorgeous apartment with an amazing view in an up and coming area of Boston. Donny and co were amazing hosts leaving no stone unturned in providing a space full of comfort and relaxation. Also very close to conference venues without any of the commercialism. Seriously, pick this space if only to see the spectacular view from their living room window and for wonderful conversation.",1
"Great place to stay. It's just as described, an awesome loft-style apartment with a furnished room. The location is pretty convenient, both to the convention center area (walkable) and public transit to go elsewhere. Donny and Chris are great hosts and made sure I had everything I needed. They'll give you lots of suggestions if you want it and are fun to talk to, or they'll give you space to do your own thing (which I needed to do because I was here on work). And they give some of the best directions so their place was easy to find.",1
"Donnie and Chris were terrific hosts and even better people! The entire stay was seamless, the whole place was clean and beautiful, and I would definitely stay there again!",1
"I felt very welcome right away. The space was just as bright and cheery as in the photos. My hosts provided lots of great local information and were very considerate. The room was private, quiet and the bed was very comfortable. I had a great overall experience and I would recommend it to everyone. ",1
"Donald was great! Room was neat and clean. Donald was very accommodating and helpful. Location is walking distance to the convention center, but I would say more on the 15-min side (average pace). I
would book again. ",1
"A terrific couple of guys and super helpful. Great location and a beautiful, modern home. Thanks!",1
"Donny is a fantastic host - very welcoming and helpful prior to my arrival and throughout my visit. The apartment is very clean, bright, and comfortable. Great location too - just a few blocks from cafes and public transportation. Definitely recommend!!",1
"Every aspect of my experience staying at Donny's place was outstanding.   Interactions were helpful and fast, the location was perfect (conference center, beach, downtown, restaurants, etc.), and the apartment was spacious and comfortable.  My stay couldn't have been better.",1
"Great place to stay, and an excellect host.  It was a great location within walking distance to the convention center and a few good restaurants and bars.  I would definitely recommend this stay.",1
"It was really great working with Lev. He was extremely helpful and accommodating during the entire process.

I was renting the space for a client and he was very happy and comfortable at Lev's penthouse. The location's very close proximity to the Red Line was a big plus. Lev made everything very easy and clear for both the client and myself.

Overall I'm very happy with my experience!",1
"Lev was an excellent host -- very responsive and accommodating. His tidy, well-apportioned flat was centrally located.  We easily could get to all that we needed to do while in Boston.  I hope to stay here again the next time i visit Boston!",1
A++,1
"This was my first time using airbnb and decided to use it since my husband's parent would be with us and we wanted to all stay together.  We had a great time staying at Lev's place. The location was absolutely perfect and the house met our needs. We were provided with everything we needed and were able to rest comfortably, much better than staying in a hotel. ",1
Very comfortable 2 bd with a great location. A few minutes walk to great restaurants and the Boston commons. ,1
"Lev's place is excellent. This pretty much sums up this review. You will simply not find a better place in that location (which is the best in Boston). It comes at a price of course, but it was worth it for us. TIP: If you're looking for food late at night near Lev's place, then eat at the tavern on Cambridge St. ",1
"Clean place, ease of check-in/out and great location made this place perfect for 2 of my employees to stay.  Thank you so much for coordinating with me on this visit!!!",1
"Lev is an amazing host.  From his detailed to do list in the area to his overall hospitality (including fresh fruit and cold beverages available to us when we arrived), this was a great rental at a very inexpensive price.  You couldn't ask for a better location.  Quiet and safe neighborhood had plenty of available amenities.  ",1
Lev's place is in an awesome location! Very cute street that is right in the middle of everything. He was very hospitable and the place was clean :),1
"Lev is an amazing host, he makes you feel very welcome (from the welcome bottle of wine to the excellent cupcakes). He’s there whenever you need something and he makes sure you have everything you need to enjoy your stay!  

The apartment is very, very clean and fully equipped and the location is excellent (it’s one of the best neighborhoods in Boston). The balance price/location is correct. 

You won’t find a better place in this area and I highly recommend staying with Lev! ",1
"Lev's place is clean, spacious, and convenient as advertised. It is located right in Beacon hill with shops and restaurants one block away. If you are looking for a spacious, safe, and comfortable location in Boston, I highly recommend Lev's apartment. ",1
"Very good apartment, good location . 
Kitchen well equipped, but it' s necessary a bread toaster.",1
"Lev's place was just as advertised. The apartment is great: big kitchen, comfortable beds, and very clean. It's also in a really nice area in Boston. Tons of great restaurants and bars within a few blocks away. Would highly recommend to anyone. ",1
"Lev's apartment was the perfect location for us during our stay. My sister, boyfriend and I traveled to Boston for the first time and decided to stay at an AirBnB apartment rather than a hotel. We ended up spending less because we could easily walk everywhere. Lev also graciously left us use of his breakfast cereals and fruit. We could also use anything in the fridge so long as we replaced the items. 

The apartment itself was very comfortable and clean. All the photos of the interior are accurate to the listing. 

The neighbourhood is very unique and old with brick streets and historical places of note all around us. There's a grocery store, a pub around the corner for great local beers and delicious food and we walked to the Freedom Trail within 5 minutes. I would highly recommend Lev's apartment for your stay in Boston.

",1
"The location is perfect and overall the apt is pleasant.  Few things one should know:  building is a walk up to the 4th floor, narrow stairs.  Beds are against the wall.  Otherwise description on point.",1
Lev is a great host- super easy to coordinate with and excellent in every way to make us feel at home. The apt was exactly as stated and amenities are wonderful. I would highly recommend Lev and this apt to anyone. Airbnb had in mind hosts like Lev as the exemplar for the business.,1
"Four of us recently stayed at Lev's place for 4 nights over the Boston Marathon weekend. What we loved specifically, apart from everything:

- Location: Proximity to good restaurants, Whole Foods, pharmacy, the T. Everything felt accessible. 
- Noise level: was very low. I almost had to make noise to feel comfortable.
-Access & instruction: everything was laid out clearly, and potential concerns were addressed before they could ever become problems. Lev spelled everything out crystal clear.
-Amenities: Has everything you'd want & expect of a hotel as far as towels, toiletries, even little creature comforts like chocolates & water. 
The place itself is well taken care of and accurately represented in the pictures. Would definitely stay here again.",1
Lev was great - everything he told us was completely accurate. He put some milk and OJ in the fridge for us before we arrived and even some chocolates on the bed. Nice touches. The place was clean and in a great location for us. Really enjoyed walking around Beacon Hill and would def recommend. ,1
"Lev is absolutely correct when he mentions the location of his place! You're right in the middle of it all! Great bars and restaurants are all within walking distance, as is Boston Common, Freedom Trail, North End, New England Aquarium, Boston Harbor, etc. And there is a Starbucks right around the corner from the apartment :) Lev answered all my questions and made sure I felt super comfortable with everything. The beds are comfy, the place is warm, the shower is hot... All in all this is a fantastic place to stay!",1
Lev was an amazing host and his place was just as described. We couldn't have picked a better centrally located place that enabled us to walk everywhere. He accommodated us with an early check in and a late check out. He even treated us with a bottle of wine with a sweet note and chocolates on the bed. I would highly recommend Lev's place and would love to stay there again. ,1
Lev was a great host. We had access to the things in his apartment. He accommodated late check-out and even moving some furniture so we could fit a baby crib. Place was in a great location with easy access to the heart of Boston.,1
"Lev was very kind and made checking in very easy, the apartment is very nice and the neighborhood is safe and charming..",1
"The apartment is located on a quite and beautiful street and is quite accessible from the subway station and in a walkable distance to the Boston Common. Lev also warmly provided us cereal and orange juices. The apartment is on the fourth floor, and so future guests with lots of baggage need to be prepared for a tough climbing. Laundry in the basement is not perfectly clean and a little bit inconvenient.",0
"The apartment is in the most convenient place you could ask for. Walking distance to the freedom trail, parks, Backbay, waterfronts and attractions. Lev's apartment is presented beautifully and very clean with everything you could need (plus Netflix anf HBO if you want to chill and watch movies!) as well as easy access to the lockbox for smooth check in/out.
Lev was very kind, easy to contact and quick to respond making our stay in Boston really great.",1
"Lev's apartment is in the perfect location to explore Boston. It was very clean and 6 of us slept there comfortably. Lev not only makes you feel welcome but also provides helpful information in advance. 

We would highly recommend this flat for a short or longer stay in Boston. 
",1
"Lev was the perfect host. He gave us a lot of very helpful information about the apt. and about the area. We felt right at home. 

What can one say about the location...we were able to walk to many of Bostons wonderful sights. There were plenty of great places to eat, all within walking distance.

I'd recommend his place for anyone who is staying just for the weekend or for a whole week or two.
",1
"The best thing of the apartment is location. Walking distance from most tourist spots. Good restaurants and bars near the apartment.

",1
"Lev was a great host, since the beginning when we got locked outside due to a key broken inside the lock. He promptly showed up to help us. Plus gave a lot of helpful information about the neighbourhood. 

The apartment's location was perfect, next to Boston Common, grocery stores and as far as I can tell we had no troubles to find items for personal care or something to eat. 

When we got inside, everything was clean with comfortable accommodations, a huge TV and bonus points to the owner for leaving fresh fruits and chocolates to his guests.

I would definitely return back.",1
"Lev is the consummate host. He is responsive, considerate, and accommodating (within reason).  This was my first time to Boston and my first time using Airbnb. I had a different booking and that host cancelled on me the morning of my arrival with no explanation! I was stressed to say the least. I found Lev's place the day of my arrival and he was super understanding.  He even got us some milk, orange juice, and bananas since he knew we were arriving super late. Such a kind gesture! He made himself available to us via text throughout my stay and remained responsive to my inquiries. His apt is clean & centrally located with a Hubway station right across the street and two equidistant train lines nearby.  In the end both the customer support staff at Airbnb and Lev turned a potential nightmare into a dream. Thanks again Lev!!",1
"Lev's place was the perfect place to stay in Boston. Couldn't have asked for a better experience. Totally accommodating, great place and always quick with responding to questions. It made for a great vacation. Can't thank him enough.",1
"Lev was a gracious, accommodating host. Check in and check out was painless, and he made a real effort to make sure that we were comfortable. I really appreciated the fact that he checked in several times during our stay.
Awesome apartment and an awesome guy. Would absolutely book again!",1
"We had a great trip to Boston! Lev's apartment was just as described. It was super clean, very convenient and just what we needed. We used every T line with ease and it was very easy to get to anything we wanted to do throughout the city. The neighborhood is charming and we loved having Whole Foods across the street to buy our breakfast items. My husband, our three kids and I all slept very well and were so thankful not to be in a hotel each night. We could spread out some and massage our feet from all that walking we did! We had a great experience for our kids first ""big"" trip!",1
"This is the perfect spot to explore Boston from: a charming 2BR apartment with roofdeck in Beacon Hill.  Super close to historic sights and public transportation that can take you anywhere. Check-in and departure were simple and Lev is a caring host who is always available, while standing back to allow privacy. Friendly neighbors, too!",1
"Very comfortable, clean space and responsive host. Loved having cereal and fruit available for breakfast. Thanks, Lev!
",1
"Lev was very responsive to our questions before and after we arrived, and gave us great suggestions about family activities in Boston.  Our plane was delayed and we showed up at his apartment at 1:30 am with two hungry kids and not much to feed them. Lev had left cereal, milk and fruit for us, though, which was just what we needed!  His place is perfect for exploring Boston.  We were able to walk everywhere -  the Science Museum, the Duck Boats, the Freedom Trail, the Boston Commons.  And Beacon Hill is a lovely place to enjoy a walk or a jog.  The beds were very comfortable, and if your kids are like ours and need a little space to sleep, the sofa is comfortable, too.  Air conditioning worked great.  And the roof is a lovely place to have a cup of tea or glass of wine.   We would definitely stay here again.",1
"First time AirBNB'er, and I feel as though the bar will now be set too high with Lev's amazing apartment. The place itself is exactly as described, although I don't think Lev does justice to just how central his place is! Easy walking distance from most sights, and located around the corner from beautiful Beacon Hill and the Boston Commons. Lev was the consummate host, welcoming us with an impeccably clean apartment, breakfast goods, and small thoughtful touches (including chocolates on our clean towels, Boston guidebooks on the coffee table, and his own personal restaurant recommendations - which did not disappoint!). He was also very responsive! Would definitely stay here again, if Lev would have us!",1
Space was perfect and clean. Separate bedrooms. Real beds. Fridge for leftovers. Lev was a great host! Location was fabulous-subway close; cabs easily accessible. Definitely recommend it!,1
"Loved our time at Lev's Beacon Hill apartment. Super convenient to pretty much everything. Perfect location for seeing the sights in Boston. 24 hour parking garage just a short, safe walk away. Lev was a great communicator and very organized. His place was clean and comfortable. Thanks again Lev, we will definitely stay with you again!!!",1
"Lev was very attentive to our needs and had immediate responses to questions, very easy to contact.  Place was lovely well kept and in a very nice area.  Thank you for everything",1
The apartment was exactly as described. Very good location on Beacon Hill and a lot of shops and food places around. I would definitely stay there again!,1
"Lev's place is awesome, the location couldn't be better, you can walk to almost everywhere (if you are into walking) or take the subway as needed. The apartment is well equipped and very confortable, + Whole Foods is in front! Lev was always available and willing to help as needed.",1
Lev was an excellent host. His place was clean and comfortable and he even stocked up on milk and fruit before arrival. He provided a list of helpful transportation tips and activities nearby. Great experience! ,1
We had a great experience during our weekend in Boston!  The apartment was in a great location and it was perfect for all the events we had over the course of the weekend (we were there for a wedding so there were a handful of events all weekend).  The apartment was spacious and comfortable and perfect for three couples.,1
"This is an amazing apartment in the heart of Beacon Hill and walking distance from the Boston Commons, downtown, harbor and more. Our family of four fit very comfortably and used the kitchen daily, which came with pots, pans, dishes and utensils. Lev was also a great host, communicating ahead of time and sending a guide before we arrived. The living room has a flat screen tv and Boston travel guides available. Wonderful experience, you can't go wrong with Lev's apartment! ",1
The host made us feel very welcome. We came late with a jet lag and found all in perfect order. ,1
"Lev reached out to me the day after our booking was confirmed. The space was exactly as he said it would be. He had milk, cereal and fruit available. He was quick to respond to my texts when I had questions. The location is PERFECT. It worked out really well for us. You must be physically capable of climbing and descending 4 flights of stairs. I loved it because it was the only work out I could fit in on my trip, but if you are injured or disabled, you will have difficulty with the stairs. ",1
"Overall, place was great! Good central location, very clean place and everything was ready for us and easy instructions for access. Also left us fruit and food for when we arrived.",1
"Had a great time in Boston! The apartment was perfect for our needs. Although there were stairs to climb, we were okay with that because that bit of extra exercise allowed to enjoy Boston's great food without guilt! The bed in the larger bedroom was very comfortable and cozy. Lev (and his brother when Lev was out of town) were accessible and answered all questions promptly. Everything from reserving his apartment to accessing the apartment was flawless. Thanks for the great accommodations Lev!",1
"Amazing experience to say the least. His apartment was located perfectly in Boston. Close to most of the sight seeing, shops and restaurants, we sometimes preferred to walk instead of Uber. Everything in the apartment was the way he described but better. Beds were extremely comfortable and couch as well. Had fresh linens and extra towels for my stay. He also greeted us with complimentary fruits and other items. He was very professional, and offered a quick response to all our questions. Will book again with him in the future. Thank you Lev.",1
"This is the second time I have stayed with Lev. He was an awesome host! He even let us check in early at short notice when a flight got changed. His place is spotless, fresh fruit, juice and milk provided, and a great location!",1
"Lev's place was extremely clean and conveniently located to everything.  He provided clear instructions about the apartment and offered guidance with local transportation and nearby stores (Whole Foods and CVS are across the street).  The neighborhood is wonderful, and we loved being able to walk to anywhere.  I would definitely stay here again.",1
" I would recommend his place to anybody who wants to be in great location in Boston. Convenience location ,right in down town 5 min away from Charles st. and Common Park. The building is really cute and small and has this great roof top. Absolutely enjoy my stay at this place.:)",1
"Lev was really nice. We were going to another Airbnb but it got cancel, we message him and he replied instantly, and made the process of Instant Booking really easy. The apartment is really nice and has everything you may need, and is also located in a nice area with some cafes and restaurants.",1
"This location is spectacular! We were able to walk everywhere in Boston (Freedom Trail, downtown, theater district, Boston Common, TD Garden, etc.). When the weather got bad we summoned an Uber, and there always seemed to be one within 5 minutes. Honestly, we couldn't have asked for a more perfect location.

The size is perfect for three people and it was a joy to be able to make some meals rather than go out all the time. 

The only drawback would be for people who are not in physical shape to walk up and down four flights of stairs. The rooftop deck is up an additional flight of stairs. This was not an issue for us, but it is worth mentioning to potential renters.

Our host, Lev, was attentive, responsive, and professional. He made sure we were comfortable and was available to answer all questions. I would highly recommend this place. ",1
"Lev is such a hospitable host. When I inquired him how to work the TV, he came over to the apartment to help us out at 11pm. Lev is physically always there to help you, and he is willing to help at all times. All the aspects that people look for when looking for a place to stay, such as location, facility, etc are all satisfacotry here.",1
"Great apartment! As soon as I checked in I could see how cute this place was. The wall colors are bright and inviting, the TV has all available (Internet) channels, the views are nice if you like red bricked buildings (and there are more panoramic views on the terrace). It was a quiet and safe neighborhood. 

The thing to note is its proximity to the Public Gardens, Copley Plaza. There are many things within walking distance. The apartment was clean and ordered when I arrived, and there were clear instructions left by Lev regarding wi-fi and kitchen use. In terms of communication, Lev was around electronically for any doubts/questions I may have had, and periodically contacted during checkin/checkout times. 

Definitely recommend! ",1
Let's apartment was so conveniently located right in the middle of everything. The apartment was so clean and the beds were super comfy. I even loved the bathroom. Overall has a perfect stay. ,1
Communication with Lev was nothing short of outstanding.  From the pre-booking all the way through to after we left.  He made us feel welcome and it was nice having the luxury of going to the roof top and a comfy home. Will give Lev a call next time I am around.  Thanks.,1
"Thoughtful, efficient and personable, Lev was a fantastic host. He was very quick to reply to messages and provided lots of useful information about the area, which was particularly useful as we travelled to Boston at short notice for a Business trip.

The apartments is in a great location within the Beacon Hill, and is very well placed for both public transport and walking around the city.

I would definitely stay again!",1
"I got an airbnb for a coworker and myself and it was AWESOME. Lev was so gracious and concerned that we had everything that we needed, which we did.  Great location and very clean. The ONLY downfall was that it was on the fourth floor and has no elevator ( We had heavy suitcases)... but honestly after the first day- we did not care and would stay there again if we could!!",1
"Lev,
Thank you, the stay in the apartment was great, we felt like staying at home, everything was there, from soap to fresh fruits and a fully equipped kitchen.
Great stay.",1
"Lev is a great host!  Communication with him was timely and his responses to our queries were very quick.  He provided us with all the information we would need and made us feel extremely welcome in his apartment, even though we didn't get to meet him in person.  The apartment is spacious, clean and a relaxing place to come back to after a day's sightseeing.  Little touches like leaving us milk and fresh fruit were appreciated, as well as providing bathroom essentials.  The Beacon Hill neighbourhood is full of history and very atmospheric.  The apartment is only a few minutes walk from a train station and there are a number of bars and restaurants within a short walk, as well as a fantastic supermarket just across the street.  All in all, an amazing stay in a beautiful city!",1
"Lev is a great host, both proactive in providing all the instructions and information to make our stay easy and responsive to our needs and questions. The apartment is very nice and VERY clean. It felt like being home. The location is amazing and the wholefoods on the other side of the street has high quality food. The only caution is that the apartment is on the fourth floor of a building and the staircase is pretty tight and steep, it just requires a little bit of effort to take the luggage up and down. We actually enjoyed the setting and didn't have any problem with it. overall, we loved it. Thank you Lev",1
This city retreat provided charming comfort and all the amenities anyone could need. It' s located in the best area of town -  convenient to freedom trail. the city's best restaurants and the T-line transit system. Lev was kind and attentive and helped make our trip to Boston  a pleasant and comfortable experience. We felt totally at home in his downtown hideaway!,1
Apartment was conveniently located to several restaurants and a T stop near Mass General! Whole foods within walking distance for cooking your own food! ,1
"What an amazing place! Thanks for having us Lev!! The apartment is in the perfect location in Boston; a few steps from Cambridge St (Whole Foods); 5 mins from Boston Common; MGT 5 mins away. You couldn't pick a better spot to explore this historic city. Lev was a great host; communicative and responsive. The apartment was spotless, with access to the most amazing roof terrace and everything you could need on hand. We'll definitely be staying here again when we come back to Boston. Thank you! ",1
"Great neighborhood!  Apartment comfortable.

Lev stayed in great contact and made it easy to get in and out!",1
"Lev is an absolutely amazing host.  He was incredibly responsive before our visit, during our stay (and even afterward as we left behind an item and he kindly mailed it to us).  He is very accommodating and thoughtful.  My daughter was recovering from surgery, and he even delivered cupcakes one night!  His apartment is spotless and well stocked.  He had fresh fruit and milk waiting for us on our arrival.  And the apartment is frankly spacious for Beacon Hill.  The beds are so comfortable.  I miss the bed in his second bedroom now that I am back home.  And the location cannot be beat.  Beacon Hill is the most beautiful neighborhood in Boston.  And the apartment is right across the street from WholeFoods, Starbucks and lots of smaller restaurants.  And it is a very close walk to MGH, the Charles Street T stop (metro) as well as all of Boston.  We travel to Boston frequently, and I will always check with Lev first to see if his apartment is available.  We could not have been happier.",1
"Everything about this place is perfect: walkability, proximity to the T, neighborhood food, bars and groceries. Parking is not fun, but that's just Boston. Lev was a great host and made sure we had everything we needed. ",1
"Great host, very responsive! Place was clean and had everything ready. Linens were clean and overall was a very enjoyable experience. Thanks to Lev, we had some great recommendations as far as eating and nightlife. Will definitely stay again.",1
"Lev's place was great and as advertised.  I did not have much need for interaction with him but he was very responsive and helpful when I did.  He has three AC units in the house in the bedrooms and living room which was great.  The location is perfect and you can easily walk to historic Charles street, MGH or Boston Common.  Even Quincy Market is only a 10-15 minute walk.  It is near the red line T so easy access to Harvard or MIT or to connect almost anywhere including the airport.  I'd definitely stay there again.",1
"Lev has been absolutely amazing!!! The apartment is located in the Center of the city, close to pretty much everything. We were 6 people staying and it felt larger enough to all of us!! Even though we hadn't have the pleasure of meeting Lev, he had everything ready for us when we arrived and was super fast at answering all of our questions. Súper recommended!!!",1
"Lev's penthouse is an ideal base for exploring Boston. It's in a great location near restaurants, shops and a subway station. The area is nice and we felt very safe there. The 
apartment  was spotlessly clean and well appointed. All communications were replied to promptly and check in and check out procedures were simple and efficient. Highly recommended.
",1
Awesome place!perfect location! Lev made it seamless for us. Watched the firework's from his deck!!!,1
Lev was very communicative even on short notice. The place is exactly as described and super clean. Loved having the fruit and milk in the fridge for the morning as I arrived after 11 pm. ,1
Lev's place in Boston was great.  Ideal location for walking to see the town.  Roof top deck was a highlight.  Communication with Lev was always very timely.   I would definitely stay here again!  ,1
"Lev's place is situated in Beacon Hill, a wonderful part of Boston.
He is quick to respond to all questions. The place looks tidy & clean. With a well equipped kitchen.
We stayed there with 5 - (2 parents w 3 kids.) and really enjoyed our stay there.",1
"Wonderful place in Boston! 
Clear and complete communication by Lev.
Good information about Boston in apartment.
Recommend this place for sure.
",1
An awesome experience given to our family by Lev. We highly recommend.,1
Great location to access all of Boston via public transit and walking.  Lev also was able to accommodate our early arrival. ,1
"Lev's place was perfect for our trip to Boston. The location was very central and easy walking distance to most anything we did-10 minute walk to Boston Common, 15 minute walk to the North end, and a quick metro to Fenway. Lev was extremely hospitable and provided a smooth checkin/check out process. Communication was on point, he was extremely timely with his responses. Thanks again Lev for allowing us to stay in your apartment, it was perfect :)",1
Amazing condo overlooking the bay! Quiet and clean. The king size and sofa beds were very comfortable. The condo had everything we needed and was centrally located. Friendly and responsive hosts. I would stay here again for sure. ,1
"Carlos was a great host! Very communicative, but not overly so. His space was as-pictured (if not better!) and absolutely wonderful. I especially enjoyed sitting out on the solarium during the warm summer nights.

The neighborhood is a historic district with lots of cafes, shops and eateries. His apartment within minutes of 2 of my favorite cafes in all of Boston, lots of great parks and gorgeous tree-lined, brick and brownstone streets.

The apartment itself was sparkling clean with luxe amenities, towels and bedding. The style and aesthetic was crisp, white and minimal. Kitchen appliances and bathroom were all brand-new, stainless steel, tech-savvy and gorgeous. It was full of natural light, with large windows overlooking local gardens and the neighborhood streets. Again, the solarium off of the bedroom was incredible, the perfect spot to share a bottle of wine with a few friends at the end of the day.

I cannot wait for my next visit to Boston and only hope that this gem of an apartment is available again! Thanks for having me Carlos!",1
We had an awesome stay at Carlos' condo.  It was neat and had everything we needed.  We couldn't find the ac remote and Carlos had one brought to us immediately! Very attentive host! It's also central to many great spots for food and drinks.  ,1
"My daughter and I stayed at Carlos' beautiful, spacious 1-bedroom apartment in Boston and absolutely loved it. Carlos was attentive and communicative, very thoughtful about making sure there were no loose ends. We were met at the apartment, where there were clear written instructions on how everything worked. Even the shower fixtures at labels so we wouldn't get drenched with cold water by accident! The apartment is in a wonderful location, the South End. We walked everywhere we needed to go. I am coming back for sure!",1
"Communication with Carlos was always easy and friendly. He responded to my questions right away. His condo in the South End was upscale as his listing said and perfect for my husband and myself. As the owner of a B&B I am very detail oriented - Carlos exceeded my expectations.

When I asked him if there was a shopping cart in the condo for the three block walk to the nearest little grocery store... his response was 'no,  but I will have one there by the time you arrive' - and he did!

I am very fussy about cleanliness and a bit of a snob about my bed, bedding, etc... The place was immaculate, the kitchen had the same high quality appliances we have at home and the bed and European style bedding were possibly better than mine at home. 

The South End is full of wonderful cafes and restaurants, old brownstones and parks. It is very walkable - there are 'T' stops nearby but you can walk to Chinatown, Boston Common and Beacon Hill if you enjoy walking.

Thank you Carlos for making our family reunion so great!",1
"Carlos made us feel welcome and met us at the apartment to give us a detailed tour of the property and explanations of how everything worked. He not only provided us with some food for breakfast but also provided recommendations of nearby places to eat. The flat was clean and tidy, and looked like the photos, with basics and essentials provided. The house instructions left in the apartment were detailed and easy to follow. Carlos checked in with us a couple days later by email to see if all was still well. He was flexible about the time we checked-out (since we had a night flight that was useful). Overall the apartment was lovely, and we liked sitting in the solarium watching birds flitting about the trees. It was an easy walk to the Orange Line, but the Silver Line (bus) was just around the corner going to Downtown Crossing or South Station. We found getting in/out of the city centre was really easy (and had a weekly MBTA pass). Getting there from the airport was straightforward.  The area was reasonably quite and felt safe enough for a big city. There was a 'Foodies' supermarket a few blocks away (while not the cheapest had the benefit of being close). It was a short walk to the Museum of Fine Art (highly recommended). The apartment appeared as the photos,  and the solarium is a great place to have breakfast or an evening meal, the bed was very comfy. The appliances in the kitchen were excellent and easy to use. 

Overall, highly recommended if you don't need to be right downtown.
",1
"The apartment is just perfect; fluffy towels, cozy bed, and tons of sunlight. 
The location was ideal. Delicious restaurants surround the apartment. The solarium is very special. It's a perfect place for having friends or to have a sunny nap. 
Carlos was extremely attentive and a great host. I recommend this apartment full heartedly! ",1
"My wife and I stayed at the townhouse as part of our Boston Marathon (Patriots Day) vacation (yes I did participate albeit very slowly).  

Communication with Carlos was easy and straight forward.  Janice met us at the door and showed us in.  The pictures do not do justice to the space.  It is very spacious for a one bedroom townhouse!!!  

The amenities were perfect and the fully equipped kitchen was nice to prepare our own meals.   We loved the South End neighborhood.  There are many excellent local restaurants and Flour just a block away became our breakfast ritual.  Stella was nice for a group lunch with some fellow runners.  Boston Chops was a fabulous way to celebrate running 26.2 miles.

The 3/4 mile walk through the neighborhood to get to Back Bay (Boylston, Newbury, Hynes Center, etc.) was serene and just the right distance.  It's not that much further to Fenway to watch the beloved Red Sox.  Between Uber, the bus and the T we had no problem getting around town.  The evenings were pretty quiet for being in a city.

The solarium was quite inviting during the mid afternoon and my wife took full advantage of the cozy environment during the brisk spring days.

We would highly recommend in this lovely townhouse and will try to book upon our next visit to Boston.

Btw, the bottle of wine upon arrival and the Pandora stations were a very nice touch!

Thank you Carlos!!!",1
"This is a lovely apartment in a great area, 10-15 minutes walk from the centre of the city. Carlos was extremely helpful and very easy to communicate with, and an excellent host!",1
"The apartment is really great. It has all modern appliances and is beautifully decorated. We particularly loved the screened in porch with the large oak table. Blackstone park is a beautiful large grassy area, which is hard to find in the city and is only a block from the apartment. We loved grabbing sandwiches at Flour and eating in the park. Carlos was a great communicator and responded within minutes to every message. We would highly recommend this AirBnB!
",1
"We love the strategic location of Nadine's place. Beautiful neighbourhood that allowed us to run every morning during this beautiful summer. Its absolutely conv with tones of restaurants, grocery stores aound. Nadine's place is exactly as shown in the pics. Lovely interior, clean and neat. 
Thanks to Nadine for her great and kind arrangement, thanks for hosting us and we had a great stay.",1
"Mary and her son were a life saver. She quickly booked my request and had me and my boyfriend in wothinn an hour. Out stay there was wonderful , they really made us feel at home. She's truly a blessing ",1
"I really enjoyed my stay at Mary's place. She was an excellent host. She was very friendly, easy to communicate with and so helpful. She took extra care to make sure that I was comfortable and had everything I needed.

The location of her place was very accessible about a 10-15 minute walk from the commuter rail station and less that 5 minutes from the bus to the nearest T station. There are a few convenience stores nearby if needed and a few places to get food. As a female traveling alone I don't think I would want to be out too late by myself, but that's most places. All in all I felt perfectly safe while I was there. 

For the hospitality, price and accessibility I would definitely recommend Mary's place. ",1
"Mary was a great host and we enjoyed staying in her lovely home. She was flexible with her check-in time and her place was very clean and tidy.
Kitchen and bathroom were easily accessible and there was no disturbance during our sleep or at any time.
Her place was a 20 minute drive from downtown Boston and close to everything we needed.
We would recommed and revisit this place without a doubtm",1
"Location of this apartment is great! We walked everywhere: riverside, MIT, main parks, shopping areas etc. Public transit is not far if you prefer. The apartment was clean and exactly as described. Communication with Christopher was smooth and he made checking in very easy even though we arrived late.",1
"Great apartment in an excellent location. Walking distance to Newbury St., the T, and pubs/restaurants. The host was very responsive to my questions and provided everything needed for an enjoyable stay. The apartment itself was very clean and had plenty of room for a 2 person stay. Would definitely stay here again",1
"Chris's apartment was great! It looked exactly like the listing, perfect for 2 people or a couple, and the location is excellent. It's extremely close to the T and easy to get into the city, and the Back Bay neighborhood also has lots of good bars and restaurants to explore. Chris was easy to communicate with, and although we did not meet him during check in I met him during our stay when he came to drop of some more decorations for the place, and he was very nice. Definitely recommend!",1
Chris was a lifesaver that took my request within an hour when we were in a bind because of a cancelled flight. He made the space accessible to us in bad weather and circumstances in a kind and prompt way. The space was in a fantastic location and was exactly as pictured. Thank you! ,1
The location was prime and I walked to Fenway without any problems. Cambridge was a short uber ride across the river! I really liked the place and everything was perfect. Thank you! ,1
"We never meet anyone. Only got email prior to our arrival with the codes to the doors.
We came six together and I got informations that there would be towels and pillows for everyone. That was not true since there were only 5 towels in the apartment.
There are also only 3 small plates and 5 coffee mugs but 6 bigger plates and some glasses.
The sleeper sofa is broken but we found some air mattress to use instead.

At arrival we also noticed that the cleaning had not been that great with something sticky on the counter top and few very dirty glasses in the cabinet.

We could leave our luggage in the apartment until 2pm that was very good for us and I noticed that the cleaning was much better after our stay. We saw that when we got back to the apartment to get the luggage.

Location is good. Not that far distance to Newbury St. 

The washing machine smells really badly.

So to sum it up then it was a OK place to stay because of location but it was not as clean as we would hope for and I am not the ""always"" cleaning type of person but if you would be coming to stay at my apartment I would at least have it clean for you (specially for this price per night)",0
"This was my second Airbnb experience.

The apartment looks like it is exclusively used for Airbnb renting. So the experience is a little different from my first Airbnb reservation, where the hosts where very welcoming and inviting. In this one, I didn't have any interaction with anyone. 

I stayed with a group of friends, we just wanted a comfortable place to stay in Boston. We were out for most of the time, so the listing served its purpose.

The pictures depicted in the listing are true in the sense that everything you see there, is in the apartment. But not as pristine as the pictures may lead you to believe. I'm not saying that the place is dirty, I'm just saying that the bedding, the walls, seats, and others, are not as perfect as shown in the pictures.

The electronic door system is a plus, it helped me and my friends get in and out of the apartment without having to deal with keys. The outdoor terrace is also a plus, it is a quiet place to just enjoy the good weather that we had and eat a little something.

Location was great, there's a lot of nearby places to eat and drink. We mostly used Uber everywhere we went, but it seemed that everywhere we went, it was not a long/hard ride back to the apartment.

If I were to make another trip to Boston with a group of friends, I would probably try this listing again. If I were to have a more private trip, say with my girlfriend, I would maybe look for another option.",0
Air condition and wifi were terrible also home was so dirty,0
"This was the worst experience ever, first they said on their listing (no pets) then they said the apartment was pet friendly, the place was absolutely covered in pet hair! I mean everywhere! It has cost me $300 to dry clean all my business suits and leisure clothing, they offered me a $100 coupon for flat book, which is a typical method to try and retain a client without compensating them the fair way, on top of this there was female hair all over the towels, I would avoid this company, they have a great customer service until something is not right, I have all emails to prove my experiences alongside photographs! Avoid this company there are so many others, I mean how can you rent a dirty apartment!?! And charge what they do",0
"Our AirBnB experience began with a man coming out of the apartment we had paid for and reserved carrying laundry. He was told by Andy that he could use the facilities. This was very off putting . When we came into the apartment we noticed that there were no washcloths. Andy was notified and quickly delivered hand towels the next day. We received one towel (stained and smelly)per person for the duration of our trip (4 days). There is a washer/dryer in the unit but you have to pay to dry your items (bring your own detergent). When we arrived, the dirty towels from a previous tenant were cascading over the washer- disgusting. There is no soap at the sinks in the kitchen or bathrooms so be prepared to buy your own. Also there is only one roll of toilet paper per bathroom so be forewarned. 

After a quick inventory of the apartment we realized that it was equipped with 3 chairs and a love seat. One of these chairs was broken and was held together with a shoelace. Since this property was advertised as something that accommodated 8 people we were very shocked and disappointed to find that this was not so. In the kitchen there is 1 glass, 4 forks, 5 spoons and 1 knife. Again, this would not even accommodate a group of 4 more or less 8. We traveled as a group of 6 so we were unable to cook/share a meal together or gather together in the living room. 2 people sat on the floor. 

This apartment has no central AC. There are fans in every room and even with the windows open the temperature remained at a balmy 80 degrees. There is very limited parking in front of the apartment. All of the spaces are labeled resident only permit parking and there were no accommodations made for us renting the space. 

The bottom unit is quite noisy when there are tenants above. It is also noisy due to the proximity to the airport. Bring ear plugs! ",0
"The apartment we rent is in the half-basement of a three-family house, located in a not-so-good, difficult-to-find neighborhood, which nonetheless is convenient to the airport and subway (walking distance of 10 minutes). 

There is a nice backyard with sloping woods extending downhill. 

The apartment is in clean but spartan condition. There are four very simple bedrooms and three dorm-style bathrooms, which will accommodate up to eight people. But the kitchen is large enough to hold 2-3 people at most with a small table that seats 2. There is also the infamous chair whose leg is held by a shoe-lace. 

The Wifi signal is weak and there is little or no signal in some of the rooms. Thanks to the basement location, it is difficult to receive carrier signal as well. 

The attached laundry room is dirty and littered with dirty linens, making it difficult to use the coin-operated washer and dryer. 

What makes it worst is the lack of A/C units. It did not help that our visit coincided with some of the hottest days in Boston, when mid-day temperature reached 103. We had four big floor fans inside, but they were as loud as the propeller of the piston-engine planes. 

But then there is value: the $288/day rate translates to $41 per person, or less than $40 if rented by a gang of eight. If you are traveling on a tight budget, then this may not be a bad choice.",0
"The house was not exactly what we expected to be. For some things different from the description.

Strenght: 
-cheap
-colse to the train
-cleanness once/day 

Weakness
-it is in a basement (no Windows)
-very tiny room without air and natural light
-impossible cooking: just one dirty pot in the kitchen 
-there was only a broken washer and no dryer (as writen)

"We did not have many opportunities to get to know our hosts.  They were away on vacation when we arrived, however, we were made aware of this ahead of time.  They arrived home on the Monday (we arrived on Saturday).  
A deciding factor for us booking here was the 6 min walk to the subway on the Orange line. However, the subway was closed for renovations on weekends in August and this information was not relayed to us.  We had to find out on our own that we needed to catch a shuttle bus to Ruggles station (this added about 20 minutes to our travels each morning and night).  
This home is supposed to have air conditioning and it definitely did not.  We were on the 3rd level in 30 degree temperatures with 2 small fans in our room, which did not cool the room much.
They promote 2 bathrooms, however, the one on the 2nd floor was too dirty to be usable.  Hot water was plentiful and the shower had good pressure, but the outlets and the fan did not work, and the floor was very dirty.  When we first arrived there was not a hand towel or soap in the bathroom, however, they were supplied when we asked for them.
We were each given a bath towel with shampoo and conditioner, but no wash cloth (even when we asked for one there was none available). 
The kitchen was clean with lots of dishes, and utensils but there was only one small frying pan and small pot to cook with. Breakfast was listed as eggs and toast but we could not find the eggs.  
The house has WIFI, however, it does not work for everyone.  My travel companion had it work on her phone, but it did not ever work on mine.
 If I return to the Boston area I would not stay here again, and I would not recommend this place.

"You know what they say about first impressions. Despite a relatively late check in, 4 p.m., as well as keeping Sean informed as to our arrival, the apartment was not ready. Sean did not prepare us for this he merely opened the door to let us in and to view an unmade bed which had obviously just been slept in, an overflowing waste basket filled with garbage in the kitchen area, dirty towels and a filthy bathtub in the bathroom. No apology was offered he simply walked over to look for the keys which were left behind then started to clean the garbage. We left to give him time to get the place in order, still no apology for the condition of the apartment as we left. Upon our return the garbage had been emptied there were fresh linens however the tub did not look like it has been cleaned.
The apartment looks way better in photos than it does in person however it is in a great location. For the money I would probably stay here again if I were by myself however not if my wife was with me.
Both check in and check out did not seem well thought out considering the number of times is done it . He did not give his apartment number and apparently the landlord where he lives has not updated the apartment list on the mailbox for over 1 year so we had to call him, this can be a real problem for someone coming from another country no phone service in the US . Upon checkout he asked me how I was going to get the keys back to him?? 

Sean seems like a nice enough guy however given the amount of experience he has renting his apartment I found he should buy now be a little more rehearsed in his routine. Perhaps charge an extra $25 and get a professional to come in and clean in between guest,at least have someone knock the dust off the fan over the bed (hasn't been done in years by the looks of it). We've stayed at many Airbnb locations and this one definitely ranks at the bottom of the list.",0
"Very centrally located therefore a little noisy at night, floor was a bit dirty, parts of bath tub was rusty, towels were stained.  We thought breakfast was included and must have misread description.  Starbucks located 2 minutes walk away which was great.",0
Honestly this wasn't a good experience. When we arrived Sean had forgotten we were here and we had to spend a fortune making a phone call to him so we could get directions on where to get the key. And to be honest his attitude was slightly rude and impatient with us. Once we had arrived we wanted to rest for an hour before going out only to be informed the bed sheets haven't been changed. The place is quite dirty and needs a good clean top to bottom. The next morning my wife woke up to find a cockroach walking across the floor. There were spiders in the bath tub which made us not want to shower there. The final straw was stepping out the apartment to find dog mess nearly everywhere. It might be a good location but the neighbourhood is dirty and unkept. I wouldn't stay here again and would spend the extra money and get a hotel next time  ,0
"Sean was a very responsive host. He answered our questions and gave very straightforward directions to getting the key, finding the apartment, and getting around the city via public transportation. We arrived earlier than the check in time and Sean cleaned the previous guest's mess when we headed out to explore the city. 
However, we were disappointed with our experience in this apartment. Our other reason for booking with this place was to see the unique interior advertised in the listing, but once we arrived, it looked like the apartment was in the process of repainting. Since it the place seemed incomplete, the apartment looked like it was in a poor state of disrepair. The windows in the bathroom had a quarter inch gap that made the bathroom very cold. The toilet needs to be bolted down and the shower curtains were held by a piece of string. At one point during our stay we had to scrub the bathtub because we thought it was still dirty. 
The price was great, but there are more comfortable places in the area.",0
"Very good localization, but a very dirty room. If you are planning to stay more than one night I don't recommend.",0
Extremely well located but poorly maintained and dirty... ,0
"Tiny room, steady place and bathroom is OK. Couldn't meet Sean but his instructions were pretty clear.",0
"My coworker and I stayed at Sean’s place this last weekend, staying from Friday to Saturday. We had confirmation from him before the week of that check in was at 12 pm but cleaning might take until 3 pm. On Friday morning, Sean informed us that he would be by in the afternoon to clean, and we said that was fine and that we wouldn’t be back before 5 pm. We waited until 6 pm to come back to the place, and nothing was cleaned still. Trash in trashcans. Dirty sheets on the bed. Dirty towel on the floor. We texted, emailed and called Sean to ask him if he was planning on cleaning and when we should expect to have the place ready. It took him forty minutes to finally text us back and said he was coming to do it now. Then a few minutes later he texted back saying he was going to clean ANOTHER one of his Air BNBs before ours. We technically should have had this Air BNB cleaned and ready at our check in at 12 pm, and ended up not having it cleaned and ready until 7 pm. After our stay, the only communication we had with Sean was having him say we didn’t return the keys that he quickly found. Disappointment would not even begin to describe how we felt. We were understanding of cleaning and schedules, but do not have check in after 12 pm or say cleaning will be done sometimes until 3 pm if you are going to keep us out of your apartment and waiting for 4 hours later. We are thankful we still got to stay there a night and that was the only reason we did not ask for a partial refund. ",0
"Positives: Easy parking, easy check in, close to the airport, powerful AC.
Negatives: sandy sheets, dirty floors.",0
The accommodation was dirty and unacceptable. The refrigerator was so smelly we could not use it. There was mildew in shower curtain. ,0
"My brother and I stayed for the night, we just needed a place to crash and came across Ellen's ad. We never really met her, but we met her husband Michael who seemed pretty nice. The place was okay but I don't think I would come back; it was a bit dirty, or maybe I'm just a neat freak. ",0
"We were greeted by Eddie who showed gave us all the info. The location was good. It was close to everything we needed. The bed was new and super comfy. The place is very old, yet it is a new property for them. They have put in a lot of new things, but I felt like a few things were a bit dirty because of the age. They did have a coffee maker but no filters or coffee. ",0
"Neighborhood wasn't bad but apartment was dingy and dark. Not worth the money.  Parking was not included as indicated in the listing and had to haggle over the parking. He wanted to charge $30 a night for parking. Upon checking in, keys were wet and sticky with who knows what. Apartment not kept up with. Light bulbs out everywhere, dirty floors, not very clean overall. Would rather spend a little bit more money and stay in a hotel. Worst air Bnb I've stayed in for the price. ",0
"It's dirty and no response from any improvement require and we are asking for fee returning, the Truth is totally different from the pics. Never live in again.",0
"Sarah is a nice person, yes, we were greeted with a hug- but we are reviewing the PLACE. The bathroom and kitchen were dirty, and I had to tell Sarah there is no soap or toilet paper left. No hand towel in bathroom. I guess my friend and I did not know we were staying in one of the worst areas in Boston - we did not feel comfortable at all walking around. (We saw a man peeing in the middle of the street!) You could hear people going through the garbage multiple times right outside our window and the neighbor was so loud our walls were rattling at 1030pm on a Sunday night. I would like to stay in a safer area.",0
"I was very excited for my trip to Boston and was thrilled at the location since I needed to spend some time at BU on top of my sightseeing plans. The area is very cute, mostly residential but walking distance to a nice park, bars and restaurants as well as a couple of markets. I had no problem finding the location and Sean mailed me the keys with entrance instructions in advance which was very convenient.
The apartment was a perfect size for me and would probably work well for a couple also. I was slightly surprised to arrive to the apartment and while it was “tidy” it was not actually clean, specifically in the bathroom. The sink and soap dispenser were matted with left over shavings and toilet had obviously not been cleaned in some time, upon opening the shower curtain there similarly was hair there too. I reached out to Sean about the mess and he assured me that I would not be charged a cleaning fee. While it was kind of him to address the issue in a timely manner, I would’ve preferred to pay the fee then to stay in a dirty place.

I was further surprised when after my arrival I received an email from Sean with a list of requests. He asked that I not tell his neighbors that I’m using his place or tell them his unit was an Airbnb. He also requested that I keep all noise to a minimum and cause no attention to be drawn to myself. I quickly got the hint that he’s renting his apartment either illegally or without permission. Not that I had any intention of hosting  a large, loud party or to introduce myself to the building… but I likely would not have selected his space if I had known that it was under the pretenses. Finally, he requested that should any packages arrive for him in the mail area that I bring them upstairs for him… his apartment was a third flood walk up. I’m not sure if he’s ever rented his unit prior to this weekend but requesting someone who’s paying you to carry your deliveries up 3 flights of stairs is not only bad etiquette it’s just slightly rude.

In the future I will be more diligent at asking questions in advance of renting a space and will definitely be looking at a different unit than this one when visiting Boston.

"The house is beautiful from the street. Inside?
It could be a charming old house. However, it is so dirty one can not imagine and smells hardly bearable. The staircase is dark at night (some sections have no lights you can put on), God save you from a bad step there. The lack of hygiene is so way out of any reasonable standard you feel to be really cheated when facing such an experience. One is wondering, how can something like this be offered for rent in old Boston without any control e.g. by the company that actually sells it, also for commission?",0
"I booked my trip to Boston 6 months ago through Airbnb for this location owned by Peter because of the supposedly good reviews for this location and that it was a clean place.  Arrived at this location on the 16th of August 2016.  Immediately, I was appalled at the condition of the residence, supposedly it having been cleaned before my arrival.  I CALLED Airbnb immediately and informed them of the problems with the address and they stated that they would open a case on these issues.  The following problems were noted and pictures were sent to Airbnb and are listed below:

1. Dirty garbage under the sink, that I had to carry down 7 flights of stairs to be rid of 
2. Moldy fruit and old and used condiments left in the refrigerator
3. Toilet handle broken the first time I used the toilet
4. Bathroom mat was dirty and molded
5. The bathtub and sink would not drain, totally clogged
6. Stained and soiled sheets, pillows, and mattress 
7. Was supposed to have Wi-Fi capability when I had booked this location.  Peter gave me a password but it did not allow me to have access
8. Only able to receive one channel on the TV
9. Rug in the bedroom was very dirty 


I called the owner and he stated that he was out of town but would come over and address my issues on Thursday, the 18th of August.  In the meantime Peter advised me to call his plumber, which I did, and he arrived the next day and fixed the problems.  Peter arrived on Thursday in the evening and I and my brother met with him.  As I addressed each problem his demeanor and attitude was very dismissive.  He stated that because of the location people stay at this address just because it is in the North End of Boston.  Apparently, in his view, all these were minor problems and the cleanness has not been an issue.  I spent a whole day cleaning the place.  Peter did refund the cleaning fee via a check.

To make my stay more comfortable and not wanting to sleep on dirty linens, my brother brought over clean linens, pillows and a new bath mat.

"Robert was very communicative, and there were no major problems with the overall AirBnB coordination experience.  That said, the other reviews for this location do not accurately describe the listing.  ""Historic"" and ""run down"" are two very different things, and unfortunately, this house is in the latter category.  While the room looks nice in the pictures online, the rest of the house appears to be a fire hazard due to the abundance of books, etc. on shelves in the hallways.  The house is nearing hoarder-status.  I also have dust allergies, and the books and old furniture (note that I did not call them antiques) really set them off. Had I been with my wife on this work trip, we would have immediately left and found another place to stay. Robert seems to be a very nice person, but this house is not suitable for AirBnB in its current form.  The house was not dirty, per se, but the amount of random ""stuff"", poor lighting, and piles everywhere made this an uncomfortable experience. ",0
"We had taken a red-eye and arrived around 06:30 am. Our room wouldn't be ready until 3pm. When we arrived, we met Victoria and she welcomed us in and told us we could leave our bags until our room was ready. She showed us the kitchen and how to use the coffee maker. The home is a nice old Victorian home with some updates throughout and possibly current updates taking place.  The common bathroom downstairs was not very clean and the kitchen had a sign asking folks to wash their dishes and put in dishwasher. The problem was the dishwasher was full and it seemed like dirty dishes stayed in the sink for several days. Not a big deal but it did feel like we were the only people that had been there. Since our room wasn't ready, we decided to take the T into Boston. The home is located in a cute little area of Jamaica Planes and a short walk to the T and local cafés. The host texted us when our room was ready. Our room was clean and cute, not the room I thought we were getting but it was ok and we did have our own bathroom. We were in Boston to run the Marathon and explore, not necessarily hang out in our room.  Overall, the accommodations met our needs and expectations. The price was right, especially in Boston on Patriots day.",0
"Rishi was not able to meet us and left the keys in a lockbox outside the unit - easy to get in. The unit's neighborhood was as advertised. While the unit was a 2 bedroom unit, the beds were not adequate for our business trip needs. The primary bed was a full size bed, and the second bed was a non-standard futon that was very hard and that had a large crease in the middle. My colleague was not able to sleep well on the second bed. 

The unit also did not appear to be professionally cleaned - dirt had collected in the corner of the bathroom for example.

Also, while I appreciate that the owners live in the unit, there was an overwhelming sense that we were staying in their place (all the food in the refrigerator, all of the bathroom items still in the shower, pictures, etc.). There was no room for our stuff in the closets because of the owner's belongings.

Next, there were minimal instructions on how to use things like the TV/Receiver, the heat in the bedrooms (wasn't able to find it).

Next, the owner was not very responsive to communication during our stay. One critical issue came up and only after we had left (2 days later) did we receive a response.

Finally, the sheets and towels appeared to be college leftovers, and one of them was quite dirty and unusable. I'd recommend asking the owners if they have purchased sheets that actually fit the bed (the top sheet on the full size bed was actually a twin size sheet) and towels that are larger than ones that you'd find at a 24hour fitness.

In summary, this unit was in line with the experience of staying at your buddy's place, but would not be considered a hotel replacement. I only write this because at the price we paid this was on par with nearby hotels and we had expected the unit to exceed the hotel experience (usually Airbnb is known for that). In this case it did not.",0
"Izzy is very efficient in his replies and he gives very long and clear instructions so if you follow them, you will have no problem with the check in. It feels like a diy process with other airbnbers in the house. The room is very small and hardly any place to open my luggage. The bedsheets smell good however the towel was dirty with lots of hair! There was also a broken light that needs to be cleared. Communicated with lzzy and he asked me to help myself to a new towel in the basement. The toilet and kitchen is fully equiped, however you are not sure if you can use anything because there are other airbnbers around and not sure if it belongs to them! The location is not as close to the airport as i thought! If you have luggages, you dont want to drag them for ten mins walk from the T station. And with a cab ride, its almost $25 away. The neighbourhood doesnt feel as good too, but still you can find many food places walking around. If you like some privacy or diy process, it can be a good choice.",0
"I would not describe this place as cozy. Far from it. There was a weird odour permeating throughout the house that was unbearable. I also thought it was a dirty. In terms of the room itself, the mattress was terrible to sleep on. All the finishings in the house were incredibly cheap. I got the impression during my entire stay that Izzy placed little effort into making guests feel welcome. All in all, not a good experience. I encourage guests to find a better Airbnb host in Boston. ",0
"The location is low profile and dirty. The house is also not a great place to stay, except the price. The room was so small i could hardly move. To use the shared bathroom was not convenient at all. The noise which continued all night long made me up at 3:30 am. I am not satisfied with my stay at all. Sorry.",0
"We were never contacted by the host when we arrived, or anytime during our visit.   We were not able to stay in the unit pictured but one on the Northend.  It was not as pleasant as the one pictured.  We were told it had 5-6 steps to go down but it actually had 11 steps! It was dark with small windows that looked out on a dirty alley, one window was covered with plastic and duct tape.  The location was very good!  Wish the actual unit would have been viewable before accepting it, perhaps our decision would have been different and less disappointing.  ",0
"Adeline is friendly and a very nice hostess. The apartment location is great. The apartment is very ""lived in"". It is obviously where Adeline lives and it felt like she just left for the weekend and left everything as is. The sheets were clean and fresh towels were left on the bed. However, there were dirty towels hanging in the bathroom as well as a used soap bar and dirty sponge in the bathroom. There was personal stuff left everywhere in somewhat disarray. It felt more that you are dropping by unannounced and staying at a friends place. ",0
"Eddie the host was very accommodating and the studio is a great location in Boston.  If that's all you care about, it's a great place to stay!  I probably wouldn't rent again for a few reasons:
- It's very loud at night (even at 3am), and the holes in the windows don't help keep a quiet space
- The theater across the street has very bright lights and the cheap window shades really don't work that well
- It was fairly dirty and had holes in the walls
- Half the power outlets didn't work
- There were no pots and pans and only a few plastic utensils (no forks at all) ",0
"This spot is great for those that wish to stay in a great location at a cheap price. Expect nothing more and nothing less.  The building is old and everything felt a bit dirty but if you just need a place to crash this is it. 
Here is my experience: 
Air conditioning was advertised but was not installed.  It was a hot/humid weekend so had I known there was no AC I would have rented elsewhere. Having prepaid for this place, I felt a bit cheated.
Ahmed and I ended up exchanging over 20 messages for the next two days to coordinate the installation of the AC, which is not something I want to be doing on a business trip/vacation. This disorganization  caused unnecessary stress and led to him asking us to leave the apartment to install the AC only to return with the AC not installed. I had to make changes to my schedule and be out of the apartment for a certain time period of the day to accommodate for something that should have been taken care of prior to my arrival and in the end nothing happened. This ordeal was beyond irritating and highly unprofessional. 
Ahmed was nice enough to lend us his office space so that I could do my work and even comped me a night for the inconvenience. However, all this could have been avoided. I appreciate the partial refund and gratuity on his part but I'd much rather pay more for a seamless experience elsewhere and not be bothered on my vacation.  Wouldn't rent again. ",0
The pictures of the apartment are attractive but the truth is not the same. The blinds of all the windows are broken so you live in the dark. In fact it's not important because the windows are so dirty that we can't see outside. The windows are broken so you're sleeping in the street. The shower is  broken and fixed by a big yellow scotch.,0
"This small studio is brand new, beautiful, and has everything one needs, including a full size kitchen. Large windows allow great light in. The neighborhood is quiet and gorgeous, super close to MGH and the T, and walking distance to downtown. The apartment complex is quiet, the hallways are dirty and old. The shower needs to be fixed, but still works. The shower glass door is falling/does not close, the faucet leaks, is hard to open/close, and the shower does not drain well.",0
"Check-in was easy and convenient. Even though we arrived early and went to the rental office to drop our bags, the woman at the desk arranged for us to check in early to the apt and drop our bags while the cleaner was still there. The location is great, in the heart of the Back Bay. Now the Oh-no-nos: the carpet is gross and should be ripped out. It was so old and dirty-looking I didn't want to step on it in bare feet. The AC was set to 78 and we couldn't turn it any lower so it was stuffy and hot the whole time (it was 90 outside). We called the office and someone came to ""fix"" it but it still never went below 78 so they must set it that high on purpose. Not OK. The apartment is in the basement and the lighting is poor - it's either really low so you can't see, or blinding. No in-between. There should be more space to hang things in the bathroom. The hook was missing from the back of the door so there was no place except a tiny towel rack to hang anything . Also, the shelf above the sink was tilted so you couldn't store anything there and there's no medicine cabinet or other storage space so we ended up putting our things on the toilet tank or the floor. One of the leather chairs in the living room was ripped, and the sofa also felt old and a bit dingy. For us, the location didn't make up for all of the inconveniences and problems. YMMV.",0
Host was very responsive and helpful. The apartment has an excellent location. My only complaint is the place is very dirty. ,0
"I was contacted by Alisa the day before, telling that she would't be able to check us in before 8:30 although the advertisement says 13:00. Since we were traveling from Niagara and we drove the whole day it was disappointing to not be able to get in before 8:30. Also, we were there by 8:30 but the couple (Alisa and Kacey) was still about 20 minutes late - not pleasant after a 8 hour drive.

I was also told ""I am preparing for your arrival today and tomorrow"".
The house was not dirty - but it was clearly not clean either, nor was ready for us. Some of the bed linen were smelly (like weird smelling), although later Alisa confirmed that they were coming from the drier just before we arrived (wasn't supposed to be already prepared?). The dishwasher was full with the guests dishes - which we had to wash by ourselves during our stay.
Although the WiFi PW was on the fridge, we didn't really get instruction until the day after.

We were pretty disappointed when we first arrived.

The noise from the railway is not a problem if you keep the windows closed, which we did - although the apartment would get ridiculous warm and not that comfortable during the night - I am talking about 81 to 85 F. We are used to sleep with 65-70, so it was pretty uncomfortable.

We also were asked to leave before 12.00, although the advertisement says 13.00.

The experience was not bad, but being on holiday we definitely felt unwelcome when we first arrived. After that first moment, the stay was ok.
The price is a bit high for what you get, considering that we paid 25$ for cleaning fees as well!",0
"The house is as on pic except dirty carpet, kitchen and (URL HIDDEN) all house was not ready for our arriving. And its noisy bcz of train and highway. It was high priced and you have to find everything on your own like wifi, essentials etc...i wont stay again at this place",0
"This apartment is in a great location near Tufts Medical Center, close to the orange line.  We were able to walk to the Boylston or Park green T line too.  It is also close to Chinatown and walkable to the Boston Common (less than a mile).  We stayed here to do college touring.  The steps to the apartment are narrow but like Katerina mentioned you will need to be able to carry your luggage up 3 flights of stairs.  Communication could have been a little better as far as how to get into the apartment, wifi access, hot water (takes a long time to get hot), and how to turn the heater down.  (We were told on our last day we cannot.)    Katerina was out of the country so we could not get immediate answers and her friend Laura did help us.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for Laura to let us into the apartment.  When we got there it was stuffy and smelled like curry.  There was also leftover food bits in the kitchen sink drain and the oven contained two dirty pans so I did not feel comfortable using the oven.  There was a microwave so we were able to heat up our cinnamon roll that we bought at Panera Bread which is about 5 blocks away.  The bed and apartment was clean overall and the sheets were nice and soft.  The bathroom is a little funky.  If you are not too picky and want a reasonable place to stay and if this location is where you want to be then you can stay here.  Since we were the first airbnb guests Katerina ever had I'm sure she can improve on the dirty sink and pans and I don't think that would happen again.  The apartment did have windows that opened to let in the fresh air and to try to air out the curry smell.  Katerina was flexible in letting us leave our luggage at the apartment before our flight in the afternoon and seemed like a very nice person.",0
"We barely saw Hermina during our short stay because she was out for work, but she seems a nice person. Directions and organization was good. Our room was a bit slovenly and the bathroom was quite dirty, probably because the host wasn't there and there were several guests in the house. ",0
"Feedback :
1) Boiling water kettle too dirty to use
2) Towel don't look comfortable to use
3)  Cooking pot too heavy to use
4)  Basement room too cold to stay unless during Summer should be ok",0
"Jesus was a very polite host and responded fairly quickly when asking questions while we stayed at his home.  We were new to airbnb and missed that the home did not have air conditioning on the listing.  This would have been fine, but I would recommend having more fans for the home then.  It was very uncomfortable and stifling, even in the basement, during the hot weather.  There was only one portable fan (and only one ceiling fan in the master bedroom) in the home.  Jesus did offer to reimburse us if we wished to purchase another fan for the home, so we appreciated that, but it was not convenient in our schedule to do so, and the weather cooled off slightly to make it more bearable.  Because not all of the windows can be opened to give a better breeze, this would especially have been helpful.  I can see where the main floor at least would be much cozier in cooler weather.

The home is definitely an older home (one of two units in the building), so there are many quirks that just come with an older home.  It was fair in cleanliness, floors definitely needed to be washed, and tub did not drain well at all, so felt dirty (Jesus warned us of this the day before we checked in, but did not know prior to booking).  Beds were comfortable, but we never used the 2nd bedroom on the main floor for sleeping due to the heat.  Our boys loved to play in the basement and appreciated the mini basketball hoop and couple of little toys down there.

The internet service was very good.  Home is right next to a bus stop, but we didn't have a chance to take public transit.  We did try a couple of the local restaurants in the town square and were very pleased with them.  Street felt safe to go for a walk in the evening (still light out) with our kids.  Free parking space is a very nice feature, too.",0
"The location was nice, however the sheets were dirty when we checked in and the person who was responsible for cleaning came in after we arrived, and we had to leave while they cleaned the rest of apartment. We were a little hesitant about sleeping there after that. The apartment was a bit dirty, missing garbage bags and the amenities were lacking (no toothpaste).

The building was nice as well, however the check in process was mechanical. No answers to questions, just a copy + paste statement to any communication. Despite the apartment having some nice, modern features, I would likely would not choose to stay here again.",0
"Located near metro station, on a quiet road. Within 15 minutes downtown.
Room is spacious and the duvet was clean, but the room is dusty (floor) and the mattress hard.
The bathroom and kitchen are terribly filthy and for that reason we would not recommend it. 
Probably everyone that stayed here, left there stuff (what became terribly dirty and is not cleaned at all). 
The hostess is very nice, but maybe has a different view about cleaning. 
",0
"I will not recommend this room for many reasons.
First, the bed squeaks, loudly! The bed is full size I believe. The springs inside the mattress kept me awake all night. The pillow, sheet and quilt is not very clean as you can smell something you don't want to. The floor is unbelievable dirty! No one have never cleaned it. If your cloth drops on the floor, when you pick it up, you will see dirt.
No AC, no fans in the room. I was there 9 nights. First 5 nights, the room temp was 85! The other 4 nights, it was 55! And the quilt is so thin. It was too cold, I have to wear all my cloth so I can sleep a little.
No three pin power outlet in the room, I couldn't charge my computer!!!!!! wifi in this room is very weak, you can't even open (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN), you have to go to the kitchen if you want to use wifi. Sound proofing of the room is very bad. You can hear everything if you know what I mean.
There are 4 rooms in the house to share one bath. There is a trash can in the bath and someone will come here clean it every many days! It can be very full and smells!
Overall speaking. The house is close to the Red line, the neighborhood is okay. But, the room is just not very good. So, if you really care about the bed, the sanitation of the room, I suggest you go somewhere else.",0
"My mum and I stayed here for about a week. We just wanted to start of by saying that we aren't crazy and high demanding people. First, we booked this room but the owner was about to let us stay downstairs in an uglier room without asking us. Second, the apartment had an uncomfortable odor that we had to buy candles on the first night there because we couldn't stand the smell. Also, the kitchen was dirty, and both the floor and bed were dusty. The bathroom was a mess with random things made as decorations. The owner didn't give us enough toilet papers to use so we had to use tissues and napkins. At night, it got so dark that we couldn't be able to see so when we left the apartment in the afternoon, we had to leave the lights in the hallway on. The owner was uncomfortable with that which was just ridiculous. We've been to so many Airbnb apartments with the same price before and they were all much higher quality. We will not recommend this place at all. It was the worst experience of Airbnb that we've ever had.",0
"We were incredibly disappointed by the poor communication with the host, Anthony. Our reservation was accepted on May 5 for a stay starting on June 29. We messaged Anthony twice through the Airbnb website, texted him, and called him inquiring about check in time and procedure from May 5 to June 28, and had to call Airbnb with concern that we would not have a place to stay due to lack of communication. The Airbnb representative confirmed that Anthony had received and not responded to our messages, and called him to inquire. We did not hear from Anthony until 8:30am on the day of check in, and he claimed that he did not receive any messages.

The actual stay:
Pros:
-Location, location, location. Located right in the heart of North End/Little Italy, you can walk to many restaurants, Mike's Pastry, Faneuil Hall, and Quincy Market.

Cons:
-No windows or natural lighting
-Poor ventilation
-Poor internet and phone connectivity
-Footsteps of tenants above are loud
-Small and uncomforable bed
-Dirty bathroom, which made us question whether sheets were clean and changed, etc.
-Continued poor communication. Anthony would take two hours to respond to our inquiries (about amenities) and did not inform us of check out time or procedure.

We would not stay here again or recommend it to our friends/family.",0
"Very convenient location in the heart of the north end.
Anthony was very welcoming and helpful.
The apartment was roomy but maybe a little dirty.",0
"Overall,on a scale of one to ten,  this property would rate a 5.  Pictures  of apartment are much better than in person. Furniture was worn with paint splashes on dining chairs, couch faded and stained. Kitchen was definitely not as clean as should be. We , thankfully brought Clorox wipes with us to clean stove, dishwasher and toaster oven.  Half bath sink leaked, front doorknob fell off, patio and outside furniture was filthy. No way could we sit outdoors to enjoy that space.  One large window in living room was boarded up with plywood.  Landlord explained they had a bad winter and ice had damaged window....but this was middle of May!  This apartment has no central air.  Landlord stated when I called window units were not needed as yet.  Place was ,therefore very stuffy.  Doors to a utility closet fell off..nearly scared us to death.  When I complained to landlord unit was dirty, her response was , ""It is clean... but old.""  Linens may have been clean but were very faded and should be replaced. Good things?  Have to say, beds were comfortable, inside of fridge was clean (certainly not the top) and yes,it is in a good location.  If you are driving, however, be prepared to pay dearly for parking and you must pick car up from overnight parking by 8:00 AM . (Hence, no sleeping in on vacation.) Myself and fellow travelers agreed we would never stay here again.  Perhaps we are used to better accommodations.",0
"We were going to a medicalcongress and decided to use Airbnb as we are doing frequently. After some messages ,always with prolixanswers, we decided to rent. We needed the apartment for 7days but it was available only for 5days. Edward offered us the penthouse for 2days and promised to help us with our luggage because there were a lot of stairs from 1to other. Believing in it we had rent the penthouse. The bad things started when we arrived. The parking that wehad rent and paid separated was, a real swamp, and after a raining day , we had to walk among the mud until the backdoor. I had to walk untill the frontdoor, one square of mud to open that. The studio, was a basement, dark, dusty and smelling bad. If you see it at the website andsee it alive you will believe in photoshop. There were scary statues at the wall and a lot of old food atthe freezer. We found also a bag with some dirt clothes into the wardrobe. We expected somebody there to showus how to use the things into the apartment, where we could find brooms, vacuumcleaner and things to clean the place but nobody appeared. The dishes were dusty and the blackcarpet was dirty. The towels lookslike sandpapers. We cleaned the things and as we didn't have toomuch time, we decided to stay. The second day the wi-fi didn't work and we texted Edward and he told us that his wi-fi was workinggood and that he tryed to fix ours. We stayed more than 24hours without connection. Instead of invite us to go to the penthouse to use it, he suggested us togoto Starbucks. The first time that we met him we expect something like, good afternoon or a welcome, but he was talking with his cellphone and didn't talked nothing tous. Later he knocked our door andagain just said tous that he was trying to fix the wi-fi. Changing the rooms we combine at 9 A.M. and nobody,Edward or his employees appeared. We had to carry all our luggage for a lot of stairs, very narrow, alone. We left all our luggage under the stairs, with no safe and went to our congress. Around 4 P.M. we returned, and we were invited to take our shoes off and we had to walk on a , not too clean, ground. Edward was washing 2 hand towels that he said that we left into his studio, dirt, and said that we left the studio messy. What about the clean tax? I said him that I had some complains and he answered me: You have to leave this house right now ! That time we had to look in a hurry for some available room in Boston, took our luggage and went out. If you are lookin for a good place , with somebody gentle and helpful, forget Edward, basement (called studio), penthouse and his swamp (called parking). We never had been outraged like that.",0
The room looked just like the picture.  The bathroom was a little bit dirty but to be expected for such a small space.  I did have some trouble communicating with the host.  I asked the address and ended up going back through emails to find it and so I was late to check in.  The host did not meet me there it was another man. I got a text from her asking where I was and the gentleman who let me in seemed to be very frustrated.  I would have liked to see a more professional approach in communication.  ,0
"Pros:
- Central location, walking distance to all the areas you would want to visit. Chinatown is a little sketchy but I think that's the case for most Chinatowns in major cities.

- The space is very large.

- Cool vibe

- David was really nice, helpful, and extremely responsive throughout the whole process. 

Cons:

- 5 large, rickety flights of stairs up and down to the condo

- The place was mostly clean but definitely feels worn in

- Washroom is pretty dingy. Toilet hugs the wall so you need to sit at an angle, the sink in the washroom was broken so we had to use the kitchen sink, the shower is small and unpleasant, shower floor mat was dirty.

I would rate David's place a 6/10, it would be a 7/10 if you could replace the whole washroom situation. ",0
"This listing was okay - it served the purpose and accurate as the description. However, there were a few things that I thought could improve. The carpet was dirty, the comforter smelled like cigarettes and cups were dusty. And I think that visitors would find it helpful to have a little more toiletries in the bathroom such as toothpaste and soap. But Anthony was a great, kind host. He was willing to help with anything and we appreciate that. The location was great, too. There is public transportation nearby and the neighborhood seemed safe and quiet. This place could be a great listing with a few improvements! ",0
"Anthonys apartment is in a nice part of Boston and he was very easy to deal with- he knows a lot about the area and has a good sense of humor. However, if you are a non-smoker this might not be the place for you, the apartment and bedding smelt strongly of cigarette smoke to the point where we struggled to sleep. Likewise, if you are travelling with young children who are crawling you might wish to look elsewhere as the apartment floors are rather unclean. Overall, good location and a nice host, but it wasn't the right place for us.",0
"Christopher & Dylan's condo was absolutely beautiful and location was very convenient.  The check-in instructions were extremely detailed.  Our only issue with the property was the lack of storage. The closets, drawers and counters were full of personal items.  The home was well organized but I was surprised to find the dishwasher filled with dirty dishes and no space in the refrigerator/freezer.  Christopher responded quickly to my text and explained that the condo is their full-time residence and not a ""rental property"".  He said I could take the beer out of the fridge to make more room for our stuff but we decided to avoid the hassle and do take-out for our meals.  All in all we were happy with the rental.",0
"Although the apartment is located in a good spot, the room is a bit dirty. The host claimed that the bedsheets were clean but had some blood stains on them. Also the bathroom is not in the best condition. Would not recommend this place unless on a tight budget. 

P.S. The other flat mate said that he saw a rat running in his room
P.S.2 Don't expect a living room as there isn't one",0
"Unfortunately our stay wasn't as good as we expected, mainly because the building, in general, wasn't clean. I'm not that person who is addicted to cleanliness, but in this case the place was truly dirty. You know when we clean only superficially... and under the bed, behind the furniture, the windows, they are all dirty? It happens with me sometimes in my room, but it's my place... (:P) When the place is to receive guests it must be very clean, all clean!
The kitchen was completely dirty... the cooker was covered by food scraps... The common area was very unclean, with dust everywhere... and a lot of cigarette butts... Our room and the bathroom were, as I said, only slightly clean.

Other thing that bothered us a bit was that we arrived at 4pm, the time when the check-in started, but there was no one to receive us... The person who knew where the keys of our room were arrived only 1 hour later.

On the other hand, the location was good, near the subway station.
And the fridge inside the room really helped us, since using the kitchen wasn't a viable option.

"First, the positives, the apartment (we were in Apt. 2), is right next to a police station so you do feel safe.  You are within a five minute walk from the Fields Corner T station and you can be anywhere in Boston in 30 minutes.  You are close to shopping and a very nice restaurant, The Blarney Stone.  Also the beds were comfortable.
Now the negatives, the Dortchester neighborhood is pretty low income, unclean, with half of the storefronts vacant.  It is improving but slowly.  Take a look at the Wiki page for this neighborhood before you rent.  We did, however, feel safe walking around.  The apartment is as pictured, but  was unclean in the kitchen area and the upstairs bathroom.  The towels were thin and used, and there were no washcloths.  The wood flooring in the main level was squishy and we avoided walking on certain areas for fear of breaking it.  The house is Victorian; but this back apartment had no Victorian features.  Also, there is a lack of curtains in the kitchen, upper bath and upper hallway.
Although we had a great trip to Boston and the apartment was habitable, we would not recommend.",0
"The Airbnb photograph of the guest room is not representative of the general state of the property. The guest room wardrobe contained belongings of another person, hallways had furniture items which seemed to be in transit & the living room was occupied as a bedroom by two & sometimes three people with personal belongings scattered throughout.. The kitchen was in a state of disarray with unwashed dishes etc. 
Of particular concern was the unclean state of the kitchen, bathroom & floors.
On two occasions I found the door to my guest room open after returning from a day out- there was no way of locking the door to secure my belongings prior to leaving. This concerned me given that apart from the host there appeared to be two  other sets of guests certainly unknown to me & probably the host. While my property was intact the security was not satisfactory.

"I recently stayed at Jason's apartment for five nights owing to a conference I had attended at the Seaport Hotel. Getting into the app. was no problem, due to the suitable arrangment which was aptly communicated.
The app. was conveniently situated, 20 minutes T ride from Andrew station which is a true five minutes walk from the app.
While I was there Jason and his wife were on holiday, arriving only on my last day- So I virtually had the place on my own which was fine. My only companion was one of the cats who wanted access once I was awake, and purred her way in.
The app. itself is nice, fully equipped, and the neighborhood felt safe and quite.
My room was nice, comfortable bed with storage place.
The one small flaw was the coffee machine that was left unclean, but since Jason left coffee bags as an alternative, I used them to my satisfaction. There were also sweets and small other things to welcome me.
The place is recommended.  ",0
"The house matched the photos, was spacious. Our first time using AirBnB not sure how this would go. His 3 ring binder did have a great deal of helpful information. We had a party of 6 in town for a wedding.  Unfortunately we had a miss communication about the TV's and cable.  We had planned to watch the World Cup games in our down time.   The house had it pro's and con's.  The main living area and bedrooms were clean.   The bathroom only had one hand towel.  When we arrived there was two bars of opened used soap in the shower.  The freezer was filthy dirty and full of food, some of the countertops had stains.
He did leave us 6 different colored bathroom towels.  Poor quality, half of them were stained and smelled spoiled so we just shared among the family.
Location was great for our needs in Jamaica Plains.  Easy to walk to the necessary locations. But like other people have noted, it's tricky when ordering cabs because of the funky address, access and roundabout.  Depending on where you need to travel this might or might not be an issue.   You do need to cross the road 4 times (because of the roundabout)  and two of the crosswalks are on curves and the traffic moves very quickly (40 MPH).  If you have children or elderly people I would take this into consideration.   The Orange Line stop is quit a distance away, at least 1 mile.  Pack sneakers to walk because Emmanuel is not very forthcoming on the distance to all the restaurants, shops and grocery stores. We did enjoyed our stay.


 ",0
" We booked this house in January for a July vacation. It was listed as a single family with 1.5 baths and laundry.  Emmanuel was gracious to let us in at 1pm to drop off our stuff. We found the house clean for the most part, but only 1 bath and no laundry!  This was not a major inconvenience, but not what I paid for. We were not informed of the house being remodeled.  The cabinet where the pots were kept was dirty and the bathroom had used soap in the tub.  Also, there were wires sticking out of the wall in the hall. Most of the plugs in the house were 2 prong so we had to get adapters and an extension cord. The walk to the train took every bit of 20 min. The binder of pamphlets with sites to see and directions was helpful. Emmanuel did say he was keeping his car in the garage, of which we heard a few times. But he failed to mention that he was staying in the cellar as well!  After 3 days of running around Boston we figured that out and found it unsettling, but did not have enough time to change our accommodations. AGAIN THIS WAS LISTED AS A SINGLE FAMILY HOUSE! That is what I paid for and would not have stayed knowing all this now. We also found the traffic noise was quite excessive, even with the air conditioners running, since you can see a two lane rotary from the front window. It was also hard to sleep hearing the sirens from the ambulances to the hospital 3 blocks away! I would not recommend staying there due to the noise factor and the misrepresentation of this being a single family house. ",0
"Ok, the location of this apartment is just perfect. The neighborhood is nice, you can walk everywhere from here. But (and there is a major but), this apartment is really worn (rug, furniture) and dirty to be honest. The sheets and bed were fine and clean but the kitchen and most of all the bathroom/shower felt really dirty. Beside the fact that the shower wasn't clean it also didn't have enough power to rinse your hair properly. 
I have to say that this place is too cheap to be true, I would definitely recommend to pay the extra dollars to end up in a cleaner apartment. However, if you don't mind staying in a ""student-like"" apartment in the best neighborhood of Boston, than this is your place!",0
"Sadly, we found the apartment overpriced and on the grubby side.  Things that felt shabby: the bed had sheets were not good quality and too small for the mattress. Pillows smelled musty. Wall to wall carpet needs a shampoo.  Moldy dirty shower edges. Heat kicked on the night and there was no way to adjust it. 
Overall if felt like student housing-which would be fine except it was the same price as a decent hotel! 
One positive: great location, right in Back Bay. ",0
"I'm not really sure where to start. Before going into detail, I'll provide the bird's eye view of my experience. Despite this studio being slightly more expensive than others, we were really excited about this place due to the reviews, location and the photos. However, the owner never responded to our calls/emails/texts, the studio was unclean when we arrived, had bad towels and sheets, noisy and my fiancé and I ended up just buying a hotel the last night to have somewhere nice to sleep (even though we had already paid for this Airbnb). 

When we arrived, Bernie was unresponsive and a local neighbor/Bed and Breakfast had to track him down to get us keys.  When we finally got inside the studio, we noticed it wasn't cleaned from the previous tenants - full trash cans, towels on the floor, dirty bedsheets and loose hair everywhere.  Since I couldn't get a hold of Bernie, the local Bed and Breakfast (not associated with Airbnb) put my fiancé and I up for a few nights until the place could get cleaned.  I think they either managed Bernie's property, were helping him out or just being really really nice. The local Bed & Breakfast was great - the owners were accommodating in our situation. Unfortunately, this review isn't about them and about Bernie's place which is why it gets 2 stars.  

We stayed at Bernie's studio the last two nights of our five day trip (after three nights at the B&B). The place was (finally) cleaned nicely but we were still unsatisfied. The photos didn't do it justice. The sheets were about a 2 thread count and we had to cover the pillow cases with our t-shirts so they wouldn't scratch our faces while we slept. Plus, the comforter had weird stains on it. After one night there, we decided to scratch the studio and bought a hotel down the street to have a great place to sleep on our final night.

I was disappointed because I never felt like I wanted to spend time in the place we rented.   

We were told that due to the uncleanliness of the room when we arrived, our first night would be free (that is what the nice people at the B&B told us).  I still haven't seen a refund.

I have still never spoken to Bernie.

If I learned anything from my stay here, it's to ALWAYS get the Airbnb insurance. You never know what you're going to walk into.

I hope this review was helpful. I tried to be as straight forward and as positive as possible with our experience. ",0
"I stayed at Christie's place for three nights during my work trip to Boston. She had only seven reviews, so I suspect she's a pretty new AirBnB host. However, I was willing to take the risk because the reviews were very good (5 stars).
Unfortunately, my experience didn't match the good reviews. First, the apartment was dirty: the counters of my room were dusty with sticky marks, the carpet required vacuuming, the bathroom was dirty and full of hair. Also, based on my previous AirBnB experience, after the arrival hosts usually inform guests about the basics such as where the room and the bathroom are, hands out the key, and tells if the guest is allowed to use the kitchen and the possible WiFi info. Instead, I had to separately ask for this information from the host, and she felt very reluctant to give it to me (she was texting). 
The second evening Christie had her boyfriend (?) visiting her, and I ended up accidentally walking to the bathroom when he has there (he didn't lock the door, and I didn't know the bathroom was occupied). Last, I suspect there is at least an occasional pet (dog/cat) in the apartment since there was animal hair in my room and the bathroom, and bowls for water and food on the floor. Luckily I'm not allergic. 
On the positive side, Christie was very flexible with the check-in time (due to work, I arrived at 11pm), the apartment was easy to find, and well located for my purposes. The bed was very comfortable too.
However, I will be using some other place next time.",0
"Well, maybe it is just because all our previous Airbnb experiences were so great that we are spoiled, so this one didn't work out for us. We did not feel welcomed at all, the room was super dirty when we arrived, the hosts were not home maybe that was why. We had to leave so didn't stay even though we booked for 2 days. Hopefully, they will deliver a better experience for the future Airbnb guests :)",0
"Viktoria was very communicative prior to our booking and arrival, and was able to offer tips on how to get to Boston from New York, which was very kind. She also asked a bit about us so as to check we were appropriate guests for her apartment and area, which was beneficial for both host and guest arrival at the apartment was easy, though we did not meet Victoria. It was unfortunate that the outside seating was wet and dirty on arrival, but overall the apartment was really nice and in good condition, in an excellent part of town. It was great to have a booklet of local recommendations. It was a shame however, that I had a problem with my bed on two nights of the three night stay. I was awoken in the night by one of the three slats of the bed (bedroom two) breaking, and as such was unable to sleep on the bed for the rest of the night. Although someone came to make sure it held up for the second night, the same thing happened again, as the bed was not in the best condition with two mattresses on top of one another, springs visible and only a few slats underneath to support the weight and I am only an average sized girl. I would recommend the location and general state of the apartment but would advise checking on the second bedroom situation. furthermore I thought this could have been dealt with a lot better. Although Victoria/her PA (I was never quite sure who was responding to my emails) was generally polite, there was no real acknowledgement of the gravity of the situation, particularly having paid a substantial amount of money for what was supposed to be a luxury apartment. All I wanted was two decent beds for the night and this was ultimately not provided. It did not really feel that we with the priority here but just part of their business and I spent a significant amount of my time having to deal with emails et cetera and eventually having to ask if there would be a financial refund of sorts of fed. I found the initial gesture of $50 quite insulting considering the bed broke two nights on the run and it was a shame we had to wait longer in order to agree on a fairer amount. I am sure other people will enjoy staying here and have the bed been fine, this would have been a really good place to stay. Unfortunate I think is the best way to describe or stay here.",0
I thought this was a wonderful place. She was very nice and helpful. The only bad thing was the dishes were kind of dirty and we realized the sheets were kind of dirty as well. Other then that great host and great place!,0
"Definitely not a pretty place. There is a reason why there is no pictures. Was told I would get a $100 back because of my disappointment with the condition of the place upon arrival but never received it. Allan used the words, we aim to ""please"" when I was booking this place. I was also told it looks similar to his other postings and lets just say it really took away from the whole experience  of Boston. This place is dirty and there is an old carpet throughout which smells moldy. For the price, not worth it and I would have rather paid a little bit more and stayed at the Hyatt. Was really mislead on the condition of the apartment. Basically, is an old smelly house waiting to be torn down but the need some money in the mean time. The subway is a 10 minute walk which isn't bad but there is no good restaurants or convenient breakfast spots near and you will definitely not feel comfortable cooking in the kitchen. Again, there is a reason there hasn't been pictures!!! STAY AWAY",0
"Unfortunately, the experience was nothing like we hoped. Major safety issue with this place. The apartment has a sliding glass door that opens to outside, that doesn't lock! We were shown this by the property manager, and informed that the only way to prevent it from opening was to lean a plank of wood on it at a certain angle. It took us 20mins to get this plank propped at an angle that wouldn't allow the door to open, but even then, who knows how well that would've held. This major safety issue should have been brought up to us BEFORE we booked, or even arrived. We did not feel safe at this apartment, and do not recommend anyone to stay there until this door has a working lock. We didn't feel safe staying here & we are requesting a refund as we stayed with friends for most of our time in Boston.",0
"Wasn't what I expected , it was in a basement , no air condition , no fans , there was a sliding window that you had to put a peach of wood in the close , and could be open from the outside , but everything I open the window flys and bugs would come in . Other then that nice quiet neighborhood , very nice host",0
"Nothing was done to make us fell like home when until now we always discovered places where our host would let us a note, with cookies, wine, coffee candies or breakfast set...etc !
Here it is the a room for a single night stay.",0
"I do not recommend this room. Josepha was an unreliable host, and I think the ""airbnb business"" she's trying to run is a little shady. There were many issues that she did not bother telling me about upfront/before I booked the room. 

First, I gave her a total price I could pay for a 3-night stay and she ended up charging me over that amount and blamed it on the airbnb fees, even though I had already given her my total budget and asked if it was doable. 

Next, she did not tell me that she also rented out other rooms to other airbnb guests, which 1) meant sharing a single bathroom between 6 people and 2) there is no  lock on the bedroom, which means you have to just trust that your belongings will be okay (even though the host room has a lock on it). 

Then, Josepha told me she personally would be there to let me in, but turns out she lives in Florida and it was her daughter who let me in.

Next, the daughter asked me to ""lie to the neighbors and just say I'm her friend"" if they ask why I'm staying there.

Then, on my last night there, Josepha's son had a date over and they stayed outside in the common space immediately next to my room talking until after 3am about ""how much money he is making off of airbnb"". 

Lastly, there was a fridge in the room which was a nice touch, except that it was full of someone else's old food and really dirty on the inside. 

I get that airbnb is not a traditional mode of accommodation and that ""you get what you pay for"" but there were just too many issues with this that seemed like the host wasn't being up front with. It would have been much better if Josepha were just honest and said ""there are other guests"" and ""I can't technically  have airbnb guests, please let me know if this makes you uncomfortable"" - but no, there was no disclosure. If you are going to have multiple guests, you should have locks for each room. This room is listed at over $120 a night but trust me, that it is barely worth $60 a night. However, her daughter (the one who let me in and actually lives in Boston) was very nice, and her pet husky is a very sweet dog. The room is in a walkable distance to Jamaica Plain. If you're literally just looking for a place to lay your head, don't mind overpaying, don't care about sharing a space w/ several other people, and don't mind being asked to lie, then this might work out okay for you. ",0
"In short: poor communication, unhygienic and dirty, electricity issues and unexpected surge pricing.

While I had always had great experiences with Airbnb, the experience with Josefa was horrible. My complaints start with unexpected surge pricing and continue with every aspect of the experience

While Josefa advertises her room for $69, when I filled the application the price changed to $87. I asked her about this change and she told me that the price depends on the day. But when I checked the price on Airbnb the next day, the website still listed it at $69. Very suspicious surge pricing.

The poor communication continues to my arrival: I wrote Josefa my arriving time at Boston and she said it would be no problem. However, when I landed in Boston at 3pm and was in the taxi she sent me a message that neither she nor her daughter were home. The daughter’s boyfriend could let me in after 5pm. I had to change my plans and wait. This was already a red flag. 

Alex, the very kind boyfriend, let me in. But then the room had some cleanliness issues: the bed looked like somebody had slept in it already and the sheets had stains. Since now it was 9 pm, I had no choice but to sleep in there. The room was cold and drafty, so the next day I asked for blankets – but the ones I received also looked like have not been laundered. This raises serious hygiene concerns.

But it get’s worse: next day there was an electricity outage in my room, and the only way to get any light was to get an extension cord from one of the rooms to mine, so that I could have one lamp. Connecting the cords, I looked on the floor and wished I hadn’t. A lot of dust. Wonder what the $50 cleaning fee is for?! The long cord was also a tripping hazard.

Neither Josepha nor her daughter – who arrived in the middle of the night but hardly spoke with me - ever bothered to ask how my experience was, or to apologize for the fact that I was without electricity. There was clearly no interest in being a good host.

In conclusion, the experience was terrible: bad communication, a drafty and dirty room, and no electricity. The host was dishonest about the price, and disinterested in my experience.

The only positive sign was the dog and the daughter’s boyfriend, Alex, who was polite and nice and tried his best.",0
"The apartment is located on one of those steep beautiful Bostonian streets, which adds a whole lot of charm to it, however the apartment itself wasn't what I expected. Perhaps I missed this from the description but if you have a 50lbs bag with you, going up the narrow staircase to the 4th floor is a big workout especially if you are a gal. The Internet didn't work even after we tried to reset it as per Anthony's instructions. As soon as I tried to go on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) I was getting Network Error and web pages wouldn't load. I switched back to my data plan and all worked as expected.The sink in the bathroom was vibrating and making loud noises  which sounded like it was about to blow up. Anthony was aware of it and suggested opening the cold water half way but that didn't help. The shower is really old and looks like it's dirty which made me uncomfortable stepping on it bare-feet. Anthony suggested he could send a cleaning lady once more but I wasn't comfortable having a stranger in the place with all of our belongings there. The apartment is pretty tight. The door has a big bolt inside which makes you question if the area is safe but Anthony assured me it was very safe neighborhood. Anthony was quick with responses. There is a great sushi right down the street I recommend: Fins Sushi and the original ""Cheers"" is about 15 min walk from Anthony's place.  Perhaps it's just me since the place has tons of good feedback so please treat this review as it is- just my honest opinion.  ",0
"It's nothing like in the pictures. The house is extremely old, there were no cover sheets; I felt like blankets were dirty; no AC. Bathroom was not clean at all. The tub was plugged up, so the water would fill up.  At least it had some Lysol (I used it before and after).  No towels. I had to ask the host to give me one which he did, but very reluctantly. ",0
"The reservation was really simple and Shawn was answering very quickly. We had no difficulty to find the keys and the place. The place was a bit dirty (dust, doors were damaged, etc.) and the location was very noisy on Friday night. But the place was very well located, 30sec from the subway station.",0
"Arrived after a long day of flying and Ketai and his wife made the check-in super quick and easy. I ended up meeting one of the guys living there too and he was super nice. The room was super nice. There was a clean, comfy bed and lots of storage space. At night the place was very quiet - I did not even hear the train station near the house. The bathroom on the other hand... Was a little scary. It was dirty and the shower was falling apart. However, this place was in a super convenient location and I could work with the scary bathroom because of the location and affordability. ",0
The apartment was not as described.  It is basic and certainly not elegant.  It is a functional space with 2 bedrooms in a good location within walking distance to lots including shopping and dining.  The carpet was very dirty and stained and many of the areas of the apartment including the kitchen and bathrooms were dated and showed signs of signicant wear.  As state above it is functional but not what was anticipated.  The pictures were also not the same as the apartment we rented.  Parking is not included and was not available during our stay even though I checked with the listing company prior and they said it would be.,0
"This was the worst experience I have ever had using AirBnb. Upon arrival at the apartment I noticed it was dirty throughout and not as clean and new as the pictures depict. There was broken furniture, the white couch was stained and the bathroom was dirty (and the sink drain didn't work). There were also dirty/wet towels hanging in the bathroom and the whole apartment smelled of cologne. Very disappointing.

Sebastian was nice, but unfortunately these were not things that could be fixed to make my short 3 day stay comfortable.

For the amount charged, I expected the place to be in good/excellent condition.",0
"Sebastien made us feel welcome at the outset. The place is run down, and not as high end as the listing makes it out to be. Right off the bat the bulb in the projector didn't work, and Sebastien said his place was 5 minutes away after an hour and after several calls and messages that were never returned by Sebastien we called Airbnb they then called him and he said he had had an emergency at his salon. Emergency or not a text message easily could have been fired off. Upon his return he didn't seem to get that he wasted our time. Instead we ended up wasting the early evening waiting for him to come back and exchange the bulb. The Tommy Bahama Egyptian cotton Towels that are a ""feature"" of this apartment shed. The fireplace is unusable and in our complaint to Airbnb which they sided with us on they refunded us partially for the fact that this is listed as an amenity yet it can't be used because there is a stereo system in the way. The couch is incredibly uncomfortable and dirty. The apartment has a mini step down that if you are not careful might be a problem. Anyone with suitcases be advised you will have to haul your stuff up two flights of stairs the final section without any railing for support. This could be explained better in Sebastien's listing. The neighborhood is great, but the building leaves a lot to be desired. Its archaic in a bad way. Its old green velvet carpet and funeral parlor layout doesn't really beckon but instead leaves you wondering who actually calls this place home, or who would want to. Our feeling is that this place is not really what it claims and the listing should be altered to reflect this. If you are into aging ""bespoke"" brands that are well past their seen date and usefulness then this is a perfect place for for you. Conclusion: buyer beware.",0
"While the pictures accurately reflect the apartment, and the hosts were very easy to communicate with, we had a poor experience in this apartment for the following reasons.
1. The key was not at the apartment at check-in, we had to wait a short time.
2. The toilet was clogged upon arrival, and the janitor had to come two times before it was fixed. Even then, flushing was slow. We were told that NO toilet paper could be placed in the toilet at all. If we had been notified of this in advance, we would not have stayed here.
3. The internal doors of the apartment lock automatically, and no key or note is provided. My son was locked in a room alone until the janitor could break the door open.
4. There was not a top sheet on the beds, and no washable cover on the duvets; this is not sanitary from guest to guest.
5. The apartment was not thoroughly cleaned, stained and dirty shower, old food left in fridge, some unclean glasses in the cabinets.
6. One of the kitchen outlets ruined a new Kindle that I purchased less than 10 days prior to our stay.

I appreciate and believe that the hosts are trying to provide a good experience, and this is a good price for a rental in Boston, but I would not stay here again due to cleanliness and the number of problems we experienced. The parking is off-street, which is nice.",0
The location was in a good area. Was an accurate description. It is located about 20 min. away from the airport. The bathroom was dirty and shower/bathtub was dirty. ,0
"The host was wonderful and communicative.  The apt is a bit old and dirty as mentioned on a few reviews.  

The paper towels had insect dirt and bathroom has a distinct smell.  The cleaniness is a biggest holdback and we couldn't get the wifi to work.  ",0
"The apartment was nice, pretty much matching the description. The little alley where it's located is quite dirty, but the area is nice, full of Italian restaurants. The apartment is perfect size for 2 people with a nice comfy bed. We didn't use the kitchen, but the bathroom was absolutely nice. The only problem, is that the walls are very thin, so during the day people were running around on the floor above us and it was really loud. You can pretty much hear all the neighbors. We had sheets, towels, everything was clean. Close to the apartment are shops and many restaurants. I would recommend the place for a few nights to look around Boston.",0
"She was very nice, but there was no wifi there :(
Kind of a far walk from the station, but close by uber
A little bit of a strange smell when I first got in
Dirty",0
"My thoughts on this listing are conflicted. Initially, my friends and I were thoroughly pleased with this choice because Sean was very accommodating, responded quickly to questions, and was even kind enough to let us store our luggage at his own home (for this we are extremely thankful). 
Our problems are not with Sean personally and I'm not sure if we caught him on a bad day, but the listing was sorely disappointing. We arranged with Sean in person to check in around 3:30 - 4 PM but we arrived to find the place still dirty from the last stay. By dirty, I mean dishes in the sink, old food in the kitchen, used towels strewn across the floor, and blankets in disarray on the bed. My friends and I had been travelling all day and were looking forward to resting for a while before heading out for the night. Sean messaged us to tell us that he would be coming in to clean and bring fresh linens around dinnertime, but he did not come until past 8PM. My friend and I were out at this time, but we came back around 8:30PM to find the place ""clean"". It was much tidier than when we first arrived and if we arrived to find the place like this, we would have been satisfied. But because we knew how long he had to clean and saw the same duvet just placed nicely on the bed (but not washed or replaced), we were not pleased.
However, we were given new towels, clean sheets for the couch bed, and found the pictures to be fairly accurate. Location was convenient and his directions to the key box were clear. I liked Sean and he seems like a really nice guy, but my friends and I will not be staying again. ",0
"When we arrived we got an email with all the instructions to get the keys of the flat. The procedure is quite unusual, but at the end practical. The apartment is older than we thought, quite dusty and dirty. Sean provided us clean sheets and towells. When we arrived he quickly cleaned the bathroom and the kitchen but in general the rest of the flat remained as the previous guests left it.
The flat was warm while the heating was working, but the windows had huge draughts, so at night you might feel cold....
The position of the flat is good (4-5 ""T"" stops from the center), but at the same price we paid, you can find a room closer to the center. We were fine for two nights, but I don't feel to recommend this place to my friends...",0
"Place was empty just as expected, and larger than expected, which was nice. Floors were dirty, and needed a run with the sweeper - fortunately there was one. Overall good communication and a good experience.",0
"The place was ok. The host responded quickly to my questions (I arrived earlier than planned and I didn't wait so long). He wasn't particularly welcoming though. The bathroom is kind of dirty, the mattress is really thin, the bed is loud. The neibourhood is really cool, families and stuff, it's right beside the subway, downtown is near. To be honest, staying there was cheap, the experience went along with it. If you can afford better, pay for better. If not, you can crash there at the end of your day and you'll still have a wonderful time in Boston.",0
"The room was clean and it looks like the photos, but the bathroom was really dirty and the people who live in the apartment so noise. There was a bad smell from kitchen",0
"Let me be totally frank. The hosts are good. Ronnie and Connie are both welcoming, helpful and friendly. And the location is fine, too. Just 3 minutes walk from the T orange line which takes you to downtown. However, if you are sensitive to cleanliness, I do not recommend here. I've been to several air bnb houses in the US and this place was the dirtiest place. There were dirt and stain everywhere you go. Kitchen, bathroom, and the living room floors everywhere. Also there were spiders and flies sleeping with me. The worst part was the towel they offered me, which had awful stink. They'd better not offer the towel if they aren't available of washing them. Anyway, if you are totally fine with dirty house, you're good. ",0
"When we arrived on Saturday neither Nina nor Mike was there.  We had to use a lock box to get the keys.  Nina asked us to say we were friends visiting if any neighbors asked.  It made me feel uncomfortable because we didn't even know their last names and she was asking us to be untruthful.
We were able to park on the street very close to the apartment, but had to be sure to leave on Monday before 8am because the street sweeper was coming and the car would be towed if it was still there.
It was a walk to get to restaurants, but there were lots to choose from and there was a Whole Foods to buy any food or snacks.
We went to Fenway Park for a Yankees/Red Sox game.  We took a taxi to get there and it only cost $12 plus tip.
We were told there would be bagels in the freezer for breakfast, we could not find any.  There was a french press coffee pot to be used to make morning coffee, but no instructions.  Not everyone is familiar with them.  We had to (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) it to find out.
The dish washer was full of dirty dishes and the dish drainer was overflowing with clean ones so I left dirty coffee cups in the sink even though we were asked to clean up after ourselves.  I did run the dishwasher but did not attempt to put anything away.
The bottom of the bath tub was not skid resistant.  When I took my shower, I slipped, but did not fall.  When Dean showered he slipped and fell pulling the shower rod down and landing on the floor.  Fortunately he did not injure himself, but he has 2 knee replacements and he was lucky.  That tub is dangerous.
Names of restaurants they recommended were left for us, but no addresses.  We had to look them up on our computer.  What would someone do if they did not come prepared?  Not everyone has a smart phone.
We never met Nina. Both Nina and Mike returned later on Sunday, but Nina was not feeling well so was in her bedroom when we got there after going to Fenway Park and dinner.  Our only knowledge of her was in e-mails.  We did talk with Mike.   ",0
"Did not get to meet host as she was out of town, but she did provide us with people to contact in Boston if needed. Instructions to house were good and got into house OK. We were not told which room we would be staying in - as there are several that she lets out - and had to contact host's friend. When we found our room the door was locked and there was someone asleep in our bed! We arrived after 1pm (which Hermina told us was the check in time) to be told by the woman in our bed that Hermina had said she could have the room until 5pm as she had just worked a night shift!! The lady kindly let us leave our massive backpacks in the room but we had to take all valuables with us. We were not informed of this by the host. 

When we came back later that evening, the room had been vacated. The room was nice and spacious and the bed was comfortable, although there was a random mattress leaned up against one of the walls. 

We were then woken up at 1.30am by two of the other guests washing and drying their clothes in the machine. As the bathroom - which is where the machines are located - was right next to our room, the noise was extremely loud and we had a lousy night's sleep. I spoke to the girls who apologised, but then kept going!! 

Even though the house is next to a police station we did not feel 100% comfortable coming back to the house in the dark because of the neighbourhood and so came home early. 

Hermina clearly uses her house as some sort of hostel. We were not expecting this. The sheets and towels were thin and there were dirty sheets on the landing and in the front room. Would not stay here again. ",0
"I am not happy about this experience. 

I spent 6 days in Boston, and I have never met Sarah, not even when I arrived.

The room was clean, but when I arrived the bathtube was very dirty, and the bathroom in general was not highly clean.

In the kitchen and in the fridge there was food left from previos renters, and some was expired months earlier. 

""Breakfast included"" simply meant you could use the food left from the other people (without knowing who bought it, when and since how long was it opened). I initially found some milk, but it was over after few days, and it was not supplied more.
Similar situation went for the shampoo (the leftover).

The flat is close to the station, so it was easy to catch a bus, but the neighboor was not the best. I did not feel safe when I was going back home at night, but this is probably one of the general problems in USA, if you go out of the city center.

The only positive remark is that when I asked Sarah (by email) if I could use an extra towel, she provided one.

I would sincerely not suggest it to a friend.
I travel a lot and often stay in hostels or in other people´s  houses; I have had more pleasant experiences and meet better hosts.  ",0
"It's terrible. There are dog hairs everywhere, in the bed, sofa , kitchen ........ The host left a dirty room for us. It seems long time no people to live . We  asked the host to clean the room , the cleaner cleaned some dog hairs but didn't clean the kitchen , bathroom , bedroom and living room . We cleaned them by own since we have to stay here 4 nights. 
The cleaner moved some rugs down the basement since there are many dog hairs on them . When we left , the host asked us to move back. We moved but didn't find two small rugs, we don't know where the cleaner place .We told the host and let her to check with the cleaner. The host said yes. But several days later, the host asked us about the rugs again, she didn't check with the cleaner, but asked us again and again . At last , I told her that we never take nothing from others.  You know the rugs are dirty and many dog hairs on them, no one want to touch them.
It is really bad experience .",0
"To be honest, The room was musty and dusty. we called it the Cave. 
Lost of things where broken, like the tiles in the bathroom. And a bit dirty. Dark room with no fresh air. 

However, the location is good And the room was really cheap compared to other options.",0
"Stuart was helpful and friendly, while still leaving us to ourselves.  He corrected the wi-fi issue mentioned in the other review, by installing a new, fast router that worked fine.

Although his description makes full disclosure about the two cats, this place could be much cleaner.  A great deal more attention needed to smells, litter box neatness, and the dirty floor.  The kitchen and, especially, the bathroom, looked and felt very dirty.  Personal products and medications left out or dumped on the floor, a soiled toilet, lots of dust on everything, and thus, not particularly inviting to use.  The bedroom door would still not close.

I don't like having to leave a negative review.  However, on the plus side -- great location, public transit, and a fun neighborhood.",0
"The condo was located in a perfect neighborhood, extremely walk-able and close to attractions such as Fenway Park and The House of Blues. The location could not be beat!
The property manager, Eddie, was fantastic to deal with. He was very friendly and cheerful and recommended some good local places to us and was quick to respond when we experienced a problem with our accommodations. The sheets in the condo were dirty and clearly not changed after the prior guest(s) left so we texted Eddie and he came by with new sheets within 30 minutes. 
Overall, this condo was worth the price and in the neighborhood that we wanted to be in. ",0
"Location, location, location!  I was in town to attend a baseball game at Fenway Park.  The apartment was only a few blocks away so getting to the game was convenient.  Our host's friend met us upon arrival and gave us a nice intro to the city.  The apartment itself was slightly dirty, the bathroom & the kitchen could have used a deep cleaning.  However, if you are looking for an inexpensive apartment in a quiet section of town near cute eateries- this is the place for you.",0
"The burner was more than dirty, revolting with rests of food, grease, etc. In general, the apartment is not clean.

WIFI connects only at certain points in the apartment and the coverage never reaches more than two lines in the icon of the laptop.

The appartment is allegedly furnished but it has just a bed, a coach, three chairs and a couple of tables. No furniture in the kitchen.
You can hear the echo there.

Kitchen empty: one mug, one spoon, one bowl and two dishes. Upon request I got coffespoon, fork, knife, saucepan and pan.
Not a single small appliance (microwave, coffe maker, toaster, etc.) only a refrigerator not really clean.

No towels. I got one upon request.

"Convenient location that is close to Boston tourist sites as well as the airport.  We walked everywhere from the apartment!  Host was very good about responding to email and made arrival a smooth experience.  That's where the positives end.  Overall, the place is very old and tired looking.  The Ikea furniture helps to make it look modern the place itself is a bit dilapidated.  Not as clean as it should be.  The kitchen sink was not clean and there was a dirty sponge lying on the bedroom night stand.  The toilet does not flush well.  No AC in one of the bedrooms upstairs so it got very hot.  Not worth the money paid.  I should have stayed at a hotel.",0
"Tom's place was roughly a 7 minute walk from the T stop Maverick and only one more stop from the airport. The neighborhood seemed kind of sketchy and we didn't feel 100% safe. Once we entered the apartment we went up the 3 flights of narrow stairs and opened the door to a thick cloud of stench. Smoke or something. If you are sensitive like we were, you will be coughing. The bedroom was decent and had no smell once we were in there, but there was a dirty towel hanging on the chair and it made us question what else might not be clean. Only a single body pillow on the bed to use as a pillow. We ended up leaving and getting a hotel room.

If you're in for a quick stop and aren't very picky then you should be fine here. ",0
"Unfortunately I am unable to give a positive review of our stay over Christmas at Gloria's place.  When my family of five arrived from CA there was no heat on the upper floor of the apartment at all (and wasn't fixed for two days). Gloria doesn't live close by so my husband had to do all the coordination with letting the heat guy in and out of the building.

The house was minimally furnished, almost like someone had moved out and just left the beds and a couple of couches. Acres of empty bookshelves, only one bedside table in all of the four bedrooms, arms of chairs and couches in the living room were loose.  There were no blankets on any of the beds (only light summer comforters). Gloria did go out and buy blankets after we asked. There was no light in the narrow, steep stairs between the floors and it never did get fixed while we were there. The apartment was pretty dirty, despite contacting Gloria ahead of time after reading other reviews. The kitchen is very basically outfitted, with mismatched silverware and only a few cooking pots.   We also discovered all the smoke detectors tossed in a cabinet and a moldy bowl of popcorn in the kitchen.   Lastly, after we left we got a very rude text about putting the trash out incorrectly when we had received no specific instructions on recycling cardboard.

Overall, I cannot agree with the listing description that describes the place as a ""luxury apartment"". My husband likened it to a grand old lady who had seen better days...

 Gloria seemed a bit defensive and it felt like every question we had, or thing we requested, she took personally. 

The single plus (and it is a big one) is that the location is very good, near Boston Common and Charles St. restaurants and shops. 

Hopefully Gloria will spend some time cleaning,  furnishing and outfitting this lovely old place more completely, it really could be fabulous.

We detailed our experience to Airbnb with pictures and they provided us with a nice travel credit. Very good customer service.",0
"Unfortunately, like Jennifer in a previous comment, I am unable to give a positive review of our stay at Gloria's place. The apartment is pretty dirty and basically furnished. Furniture seem to come from a second hand shop, and is of bad quality. Beds are not comfortable and the rooms are sad and not equipped at all (in our room for example a small bed for 2, an awful table, a dirty lamp and a magazine picture stuck on the wall to hide a hole.
However, the apartment could really be great and is very well located.
The terrasse roof (access not easy) is to be shared with other guests which is not a problem but good to know.
The neighborhood is lovely and we've enjoyed it. 
This apartment could really be fantastic with a few improvements that I'm sure will be done by the owner",0
"I stayed at Melissa's place recently with three colleagues/friends. We were in Boston for a large academic conference. Melissa wasn't there to greet us personally, but there was a lockbox outside (not how secure this is...) and we were able to get in to the apartment pretty easily. At first, there was a problem with the internet router but Melissa worked hard to get it fixed, quite a feat considering it was about 10pm. Overall, though, we found that the place was quite dirty and very basic for the price, which was about $300 a night. We realize it was a busy week in Boston but this seemed like price gouging to us. There was only one old towel per person and the bedsheets were very thin. We wondered when the duvets had last been washed.... The kitchen was pretty clean (nice fridge) but was short on some basics, including a kettle. There is no coffee machine, only a Keurig that takes capsules and doesn't make particularly good coffee. Also, it wouldn't hurt to put up a few pictures or posters on the walls! Not a very cozy atmosphere, unfortunately!",0
"Melissa was great to work with.  She was in constant communication to ensure we were taken care of.  She even offered us to stay a little later on check-out day which was much appreciated. 

My only complaint is that the floor was quite dirty.  I have 2 little kids who were crawling / walking around and their feet and pants got dirty quickly.  You could clearly see the dust / dirt pileup under the couches.  And while I'm sure if we called Melissa, she would have had it cleaned (as per her other review comments), however we were only there for 2 days and having to schedule a cleaner would have been another scheduling logistic we didn't want to have to worry about while on vacation.  And a clean rental upon arrival is an expectation that I don't think is asking too much especially with the cost of the cleaning fee.  

Overall, I would consider staying here again.

"Dan was very responsive during my Wife's and my stay in Boston. The apartment is conveniently located within 15 minutes of downtown Boston and 10 minutes from the airport.

If this apt were a hotel room, I would give it 3 stars. The room was a large enough space with a private bathroom. However, the room wasn't as clean as we would have liked it to been. 

1) the bathroom sink and shower appeared as if they hadn't been cleaned in quite some time. The floor and sides of the tub were dirty and grimy. Something that could have been easily scrubbed clean if attempted with a cleaning pad. The bathroom sink was the same scenario. There was debris all around the rim of the sink. 

2) the room had an aroma as if it was quickly cleaned/wiped down,  but again not really as clean as we would have liked. Bulbs in the lamps were covered in dust, as well as the blinds, edges of bathroom cabinets, and under the bed. 

3) there was a party next door that ran till almost 5am. Which normally we wouldn't be bothered by, but the homes are so close together we could hear every loud conversation, drunk cheer etc, which led to a poor night's rest.

4) To be fair: Dan was responsive to all my texts/emails to where I feel he may have done something if he were present during our stay, but unfortunately he wasn't. ",0
"The room is clean, but unfortunately, when we arrived, the bathrooms were dirty and remained so for the two days we were there. Not is the Airbnb that standard we are accustomed.",0
"I did not meet my host, but she was kind enough to make sure I received all necessary check in information.

The neighborhood was okay, not great. I think serene is not the right word to use. It was a low traffic street so secluded is appropriate with the consideration it is in an urban area. It was a good location for using the public train and in walking distance of conveniences.

The entrance to the home was cluttered/dirty. We were not expecting there to be three rooms rented out to different people, all sharing one bathroom, the ad could be more specific. The bigger issue with this was it was very loud. The door upstairs to the apartment and the doors to the adjacent rented rooms were very loud/squeaky and people were up and opening/closing them after midnight- it was very difficult to get rest. Also, the bathroom was small and the shower could have been cleaner. I did not use the kitchen, but seemed fine at a glance.",0
"Hi Jason,  We did not enjoy your appartment very much, we were expecting something  clean and it was not, lots of dust on the headboard, a/c, by the windows, and  the floor in the bathroom was dirty,( I picked up something that had fallen with a tissue and the tissue became grey !) It would have been nice to have 2 towels each, maybe a bottle of cool water in the fridge. The bed is not confortable.  Also maybe you could install the a/c in the next window, it is too close to the bed. And of course no Internet, we were expecting that you would call us back or fix the problem.... .hum !  We did not feel welcomed. Too bad because going with airbnd we thought we would live something different, friendlier than a hotel.  One positive thing, the location.

"Please read this review before you consider booking this place! Also please note that I am yet to leave a bad review on yelp. My partner and I have been travelling with airbnb stops for about the last 4 months and are not at all fussy travellers. 
The apartment is not what it seems when you book it.
Pictures-
The pictures on the site do not clearly represent the apartment. The photos are spaciously deceptive and do not  give a true representation of what we found when we arrived. There is not room for one person to be comfortable here let alone two travellers with suitcases. The pictures did not show how two people would have to sleep - with one on a mattress on the floor. The pictures also do not portray the state of the apartment - the kitchen and bathroom were both not in the condition in which we found the place.


Cleanliness-
The place was not acceptable to live in. It was disgusting. The bathroom tiles are filed with mould and rust and dust. The floors are all covered with dust and look like the place has never seen a broom before. I could never allow for a places would stay in to get like that let alone to leave it in such a state and have the nerve to let someone else stay there. It is an embarrassment to do such a thing. The kitchen was also disgusting and left uncleaned from when it was last used. It was in such a state that we did not feel comfortable to use the facilities. 

Overall it was a disgusting place to stay in where we can barely fit ourselves in let alone all of our luggage. I definitely do NOT recommend for anyone to stay here. We payed an outrageous price to stay in such a place - one of our most expensive stops on our trip and with out a doubt the worst. ",0
"When we arrived the key of the flat did not fit, turned out that by mistake somebody else was given the studio we were supose to stay. Unfortinatley  Sean did not warn us about that mistake. We agreed to spend our first night in studio 202 instead of 201. That studio was by far not what we had Seen on the pictures here. It was small, unclean, run down not fit to host anybody. The next day we could change from studio 202 to 201. That one was already a lot better, but still small and if tidy and clean is a must not the best place to stay. But to be honnest it was very well located, close to some Nice places to have a breakfast ie lunch and close to public transport. Not expensive, to sleep and visit Boston. ",0
"The location is great because it is so close to the airport and the metro line.  Also some really cute pubs within blocks.  We were there for only one night - for a layover- and it was the best deal in town for 4 people and convenient.  I didn't appreciate paying a $99 cleaning fee for just a few hours stay. Shawn says he has a professional cleaning team that will meet and exceed our expectations - they didn't.  It wasn't unclean, but.....  it suited our needs though.",0
"The photos and listing descriptions were really accurate. Izzy and his assistant Victoria were really friendly and welcoming, and answered all our questions with patience. The kitchen had a lot of facilities, and the room itself had a TV, fridge, closet, drawers, and desk. The air con was really useful as well. The location was perfect, even as someone who wanted to visit downtown etc - it's so close to the train to downtown, and of course the airport shuttle comes from that train station so overall, a great place to be as a traveller. The area seemed safe to me, if a little unclean, and there was a supermarket nearby to buy food, as well as some fast food places for a quick meal. Would recommend!",1
"10 out of 10 for location - the North End is historic and full of life with great bars and restaurants - although finding a breakfast spot was challenging.
This was our first experience with Airbnb, our advice is to read all info carefully and have a easy ready means of communicating with the host as Benjamin is an absentee host.
We initially had a huge problem accessing the apartment. This was a disappointing start, we did get things sussed with help from Benjamin.

""Techno Mancave"" would describe the space. It felt as if the last person had just left moments before our arrival as pizzas filled the fridge, dishes in the unclean sink, bench unwiped and rubbish in the bins. The bathroom was filthy and we were uncertain whether the bed had clean sheets. 
We also felt there was a lack of information and guest guidelines in the apartment. 
Expect a visit from lady downstairs to ask you to remove footwear upon entering the apartment, she appeared 5 minutes after our stressful initial entry.

In conclusion, location superb but lots of room for improvement.",0
